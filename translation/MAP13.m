Warlord Grund:    It's your lucky day, Halfblood, your name was cleared of cowardice. Get up, Breaza wants to see you.
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    Welcome back among us, Zan. I apologise for the harsh reception.
Tiati here has told us about what happened. The news about Valc's siege strikes yet another heavy blow against us...
We are all that's left of our campaign force, and receiving reinforcements from home was our last and only hope.
I have summoned you all here to inform you that we have run short on both time and options. You know what we must do.
Minotaur Lord Murguth:    The Earth is calling us back. We march forth, and die with honour!
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    Indeed we shall. But we will not die in vain. We have to bring the Demons to their knees.
Advisor:    Now we are a mouse, trying to bring down a mammoth. All we need is to find the right crack to slip through.
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    It is the only path left to take. Give the news to your warriors, and tell them to prepare.
High Priest Jaromir:    We've been prepared for ages, lady. All we need is for the horns to call for battle.
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    Well then, this is it... do you have any questions?
Eraanthe:    If I may... now that your precious smurf has returned, I assume our contract still holds?...
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    You will earn your vengeance, Queen of Wrath. Sooner than you may think.
Well then, you all know what to do. As for you, Zan, I want you to get some rest. We have a spare room for you and Tiati.
Advisor:    And take this Force Pike, for the love of all Gods. How have you made it so far without one? 
Advisor:    And take this Crylance, for the love of all Gods. How have you even made it so far without one- 
Grand E. M. Breaza:    I'd rather she avoided fighting now, Advisor. Give your bruises some time to heal, Zan. 
Oh, and take this journal if you wish. Perhaps a little writing will help you ease your mind before we set off.
Dismissed.

Grand E.M. Breaza:    Figure a way to get into the mine north of here and find our sappers. We're counting on you. 
This wall looks like it could be broken with a proper tool. 
You'll need a proper tool to mine this ore vein. 
The pedestal's locking mechanism prevents the ruby from being removed. 
The pedestal is empty. 
Fixer:    Look out! 
Fixer:    D-demons!!! 
Fixer:    Y-you! Zan? I need your help!
Fixer:    I was part of the forest group!... th-they sent me here to set up that roadblock to the mansion... but
when I returned to check on them, they were all gone!!! A-and cultists were looting our camp! I-I'll show you! 
Fixer:    Brrr, this place gives me the creeps. 
Fixer:    This way! Our camp was in the forest to the right. 
Fixer:    Uh, it's so cold here... I hope you know where you're taking us. 
Fixer:    Can you believe this? A rainstorm in the underground?! I told 'em it's a bad omen, I did! 
Fixer:    We had supplies stashed here, but it looks like the cultists have stolen most of them. 
Fixer:    This is where we were holding the line... no sign of battle, nothing other than the looters!
The cultist fortress is just up ahead. It's the only place where they could have taken our sisters. 
Fixer:    We were trying to tunnel around their wall and take them by surprise, but we hit this rock layer... 
Fixer:    W-wait, you're not going to assault their gate head-on, are you?! That's suicide! 
Fixer:    I-I can't believe we're doing this!... 
Fixer:    Breaza! I-I'm from the forest group, something bad happened! The cultists have captured our sisters!
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    ... 
Advisor:    We don't have any troops we can spare right at the moment... unless... Breaza? 
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    ...I don't like this a single bit but we have no choice. Zan, I need you to investigate. 
Find out what happened to our warriors, but don't take any unnecessary risks. We can't lose anyone else now...
Fixer:    I'll help with what I can. D-don't worry ma'am, we'll stay out of trouble! 
This wall looks like it could be broken with a proper tool. 
Spirit Mistress:    I've been expecting you... 
Suspicious Armor:    *Squeaks* 
Reaver:    Psst! Hey, you!
Fixer:    Sisters! We're here to save you. 
Reaver:    The levers are at the end of the corridor, set us free! 
Reaver:    Zan! Thank the Earth for sending you! We got captured by this powerful warlock. She suppressed our
minds, we couldn't even fire at her! She left her right hand in charge here...   calls herself the Spirit Mistress. 
Reaver:    The Spirit Mistress has the key to the prison. She likes to spend her time in the nearby patio. 
Reaver:    We can talk later, you have to hurry up and set us free! 
Orc Warriors:    We're free! Hail the Bonebreaker!
Witch:    Don't cheer yet, we still have to get out of here. 
Fixer:    Oh, no... w-what have they done... 
Reaver:    Bastards... 
Reaver:    Sounds like they're calling for reinforcements. 
Bear Warrior:    More skulls to crush! For the Iron Division! 
Bear Warrior:    Found our imprisoned sisters? Go report to Breaza, right away! 
Bear Warrior:    You found our captive sisters? Go debrief with Breaza immediately! 
Witch:    Sweet home. Glad to hear Breaza's in charge, Grund would've chewed us up for this mess. 
Bear Warrior:    Hail, sisters! It's good to be back among our own again. 
Reaver:    I never thought I'd make it back alive. Let's go see Breaza. 
Fixer:    F-finally, back to safety! Let's go t-tell Breaza everything that happened!

Day 54, 3rd Qrt. An. 1106
Just great!  I left my decrepit mansion hoping for an adventure and Mistress Nithriel has brought me to this damp
and dull place! On the positive side, she's entrusted me with commanding it so I will have my new servants arrange
the premises to my liking.  What won't change so soon is the presence of these persistent orcs outside of our walls.
Day 55, 3rd Qrt. An. 1106
Nithriel has finally talked about her exploits... to a certain degree. She had to expend large amounts of her power
to retrieve this mystical artifact... so that's why she needed me. She's asked me to summon my warlocks and ready
a mana funneling ritual.  It appears that she still requires energy for her upcoming journey.  Very well, I'll oblige.
Day 56, 3rd Qrt. An. 1106
Drat! Just as I returned here today, I noticed a praak running off with my Spirit Gem clutched into it's slimy claws!
I chased it all the way to the throne room, but he vanished without a trace! The cultists are still searching for it...
Day 57, 3rd Qrt. An. 1106
It seems like Nithriel is planning to leave to Hell.   She's got an appointment with the Blue Baron I presume... I hope
she doesn't plan to forget me here. I'm supposed to receive an official order from her today, and I'm quite nervous. 
Official order from the authority of High Mistress Nithriel
My dearest sister, I am departing to Hell today.  It is time for each of us to tend to their duties, and yours will
be just as important as mine. I will break the orc siege, and offer you the greenskin prisoners for interrogation.
Your duty is to find out the number of the survivors and their positions, so we can devise a plan to put an end
to their wretched presence here in the Underworld, once and for all. Fear not, as Demons will aid you in this war.
There is, however, a more urgent task at hand.  I'm expecting a particularly strong orc to show up at your door.
The Halfblood. Set up a trap, and capture her. Then throw her into the corruption pits beneath the castle.  I will
slow down her advance and buy you time to prepare. Be vigilant and make sure that she doesn't lose her life. Yet.
I shall return in due time once I bring the artifact to where it belongs. Tend to your orders. Do not disappoint me. 
Interrogation Report - Day 57, 3rd Quarter, Anum 1106
We have commenced the interrogation of the first prisoner. As expected, she has refused to talk. We applied an
increasing amount of pain, but it seems that these greenskins are well trained and devoted to their cause.  She
has ultimately died under the hot rod's pain. We will require a mentalist or a succubus to yield any result here. 
Rites of Initiation
[...] And who is more blessed than him who can harness the power of mana? Who can be more ready to overcome
his flesh than the Initiate? And the Cult shall chisel and shape this blessing in return for his devout service.
For it is him who willingly offers his fleshly eye on the altar, and him who will receive the Godly sight in turn. 
(The scroll mentions various strategic positions and interests of the Demons. A code is written at the end - 2367) 
Advisor:    Interesting plan you found... we had no clue that the cultists were infighting over the mansion. 
(The scroll bears the intricate seal of a highly ranked Pit Lord)
My faithful worshipers, I assure you that we will have a fruitful collaboration.     Your sacrifice and devotion has
earned the good favor of the Demons, and we will not leave it unpaid. The ice cave ambush is prepared, as Mistress
Nithriel has ordered. We shall keep any intrusive greenskins away from the abandoned dwarven city. - Lord Igrutius 
Keep the gate barred at all times! Supplies will be arriving via demon gating from now on, by order of the Psi Demons. 
(The scroll bears the very seal of the supreme Cult leader)
I no longer need you at the factory. Take your disciples and move to the dwarven town. Once you get there, you
will be further instructed with your tasks. Needless to say, this matter will require the utmost discretion.   -  N. 
TO DO:
1. Salvage usable crystals from tank turret
2. Refill fragfire cans and pass them to Hectus
3. Get 6 lumps of Dark Iron Ore & replace lost Spike Guns 
4. Break down & document the newly uncovered Paingun 
Bear Warrior:    Demons are attacking! Quick, sisters, to the gates!
Bear Warrior:    Arrrgh! 
Bear Warrior:    They are coming from everywhere!!! What the hell is happening?! 
Fixer:    They just keep coming!!! What do we do?!
Reaver:    We fight until we run out of ammo! For the Iron Divison! 
Abhaoth:    ...the hourglass has turned... time is slipping away... the end is closer than it appears... 
Reaver Tiati:    You see the shadow too, don't you...
When I faced Nithriel back at the Crystal Heart, she did something to me... tried to... slip into my head?
I have been feeling echoes of her emotions ever since... or at least I think so. I sense this eerie excitement.
She must be close to where we are... but enough of that. Get up, Breaza wants to see you about a new task.
Crystal Curator:    We meet again, Halfblood. You didn't think I would fall so easily, did you?
Granted our sisters had to retrieve my half conscious body from a pile of slimy worm flesh...
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    We are honoured with your presence here, Curator. Your insight is invaluable. 
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    Well then, let us begin. As you already know, we have claimed the south Cult fort.
Advisor:    Thanks to that, we could send a messenger for Valc on a safer route. We may expect reinforcements soon.
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    What's more, our warriors have searched the fortress and found important information.
Nithriel is planning to meet with the Blue Baron, right at the port city north-east of us. A capital opportunity.
Crystal Curator:    Yes, I cannot stress enough how crucial it is that we stop the Elf! 
Advisor:    A chance to both sever the snake's head, and retrieve our Sacred Disk. A way out of this disaster.
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    However, we can't assault the town gates directly. The guard towers will incinerate us!
Reports suggest that the demons are using a nearby abandoned minotaur town to store their supply of hell powder...
If we could claim it, we could use it to quickly tunnel around the town's walls and launch a surprise attack.
Advisor:    This is where you come in, sergeant. We need you to secure the depot. The problem is... Lord Murguth? 
Minotaur Lord Murguth:    The access to the town has been long sealed off. Demons can teleport inside. We can't.
My ancestors used perfectly cut rubies to open the main gates. And I happen to have inherited one of these gems.
Bonebreaker, take the ruby and place it on the pedestal where it belongs. That will power up the gate's mechanism.
Advisor:    The enemy isn't expecting you, so this should be a safer task, sergeant. Still, keep your guard up.
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    We're counting on you, Zan. Take care... dismissed. 
Abhaoth:    ...find me...put the pieces together...before they overwhelm you... 
Abhaoth:    ...yes...keep searching...release me... 
Abhaoth:    ...some secrets are best left untouched... but that won't stop you, will it?... 
Reaver Tiati:    Zan, wake up! Chieftain Zura has arrived from Valc with a few others.
Remember the dark corruption that Lith was growing back in the Clinic's labs?
Zura has found some information on that. Come on, get up, she wants to brief you with a new task.
Witch Chieftain Zura:    Ah, look who has just arrived. Our most treasured champion!
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    I'm sure you're delighted to meet Chieftain Zura too, Zan. Pleasantries aside-
Witch Chieftain Zura:    I've studied one of Lith's diaries back in Valc and uncovered... certain details.
It appears that Nithriel had managed to pierce her mind and feed her visions, gradually driving her insane.
During this unstable process, however, parts of Lith's mind were overridden by the warlock's own memories...
Her diary described images of underwater ruins and how they are tied to the manifestation of the corruption.
I believe you've seen the Cult using Valc's Grove portal to experiment with the spread of this dark slime.
If we could verify the memories, we could pinpoint the origin of this parasite and learn how to combat it.
Grand E. M. Breaza:    Jaromir knows of an underwater town built by his ancestors for archeological studies.
Witch Chieftain Zura:    ...studies of old ruins. Elven ruins... that might well be connected to Nithriel's goals.
Crystal Curator:    Of course! The Sacred Disk! She must know of something else it could be used for. 
Advisor:    Our knowledge of crystals stems from elven ruins too, after all. This slime might be a similar case.
Witch Chieftain Zura:    Regardless, you are to investigate the place, warrior. The information could be crucial. 
Grand E. M. Breaza:    Jaromir left our camp an hour ago. Head south-east of here and meet up with him.
He will aid you in finding these mysterious ruins. Please be careful... and watch your back. Dismissed.
Oh, and before I forget... try not to hamper our Brewer next time. It cost our Earth Mothers a lot of mana...

Grand E. M. Breaza:    The minotaur town should connect to the mines, search it carefully. And watch your back! 
Grand E. M. Breaza:    So your search has been far more dangerous than I had expected. Let Zura know about it. 
Grand E. M. Breaza:    Jaromir has headed south-east, towards the icy region. He will help you in your search. 
Grand E. M. Breaza:    I did not imagine I'd be sending you to such a dangerous place, Zan. Go get some rest now... 
Grand E. M. Breaza:    You've found the powder? Excellent!... Wait, that isn't the only thing you discovered, is it?
By Air's good grace! The demons have an entire factory inside the abandoned town?! And they're producing guns now?
Advisor:    Using no less than our own technology. They've picked up on crystals quite quickly it seems.
Crystal Curator:    The cultists have most likely gotten their hands on a lot of our knowledge in Valc. 
Grand E. M. Breaza:    We should have never left our home so vulnerable... oh, how foolish we have been...
Jaromir:    They stole a lot from us too, Breaza, don't fret. They've barely done anything with our technology.
Murguth:    I wouldn't call the hell powder artillery that mowed our warriors down barely anything, dwarf.
Jaromir:    Both our ancestors have relinquished them something, brother. But still, in this time we must look forth.
Advisor:    Jaromir is right, we've no time for remorse now. I'll send a team to inspect this infernal factory...
Grand E. M. Breaza:    ...indeed. We might as well learn something ourselves. That's it, gentlemen. Dismissed. 
Grand E. M. Breaza:    There's one entrance to the minotaur town just west of us. Try searching around it. 
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    You look so tired. Get some sleep and we'll talk when you are awake. 
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    What's this? You've found our sisters imprisoned in the cultist fortress?
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    Excellent, you've managed to pull this off with minimal casualties. Well done! 
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    We've taken a few expected losses, but you've managed the situation well. 
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    I was expecting this many losses... perhaps you shouldn't have intervened. 
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    They all died? Oh no... it's my fault for not preventing you to intervene... 
Well, let us make the most of this situation. We can finally take over the cultist fortress and guard our rear now.
Advisor:    Indeed. With that path cleared we can make another attempt at sending a messenger to Valc.
I will order the girls to secure the fortress and search it for any strategic information as well.
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    Very well... go rest now, Zan, you can help around the camp later. Your room should be ready. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    Yet another misfortune... find out what you can, but please be careful, Zan. I can't lose you. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    You've been through a lot... try getting more rest, perhaps it will help your memories return. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    This Nithriel lady has exploited our weakness... slithering inside Valc while we were away. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    The Sacred Disk's theft must have caused the lightning storm that plagues the Crystal Dome now. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    Without the Disk in place the crystals are fading... life in the underground will be forever scarred. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    Nithriel is insane! She has no idea what the artifact is capable of. We can't let her get away with it. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    Without crystals, the flora will dry up and rot... my sisters are doing their best to keep them energized. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    The future of the underground depends on us recovering the Disk. If demons don't kill us, starvation will. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    Nithriel must be one of the last elves alive today. I have a vague idea on what she plans to do with the Disk. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    Before going extinct, elves have left behind many wonders. We believe they are the fathers of crystal technology. 
Grand E.M. Breaza:    The Sacred Disk controls the flow of all crystals we depend so much on. Our entire civilization was founded upon it. 
Advisor:    What's this? You've retrieved enemy intel? ...my, you are quite resourceful, aren't you? Let's see...
...priority defenses, quick reaction forces... oh? A secret weapon? Interesting... hmm... there's also a code... 2367. 
Well done, Halfblood. Here, take these shards for the effort. Make sure you keep that Crylance charged and ready. 
Well done, Halfblood. Here, take these shards for the effort. With crystals dying, they're not easy to come by. 
Advisor:    I can't stress how important it is for you to disable those gate towers, Zan. Find a way into the mine! 
Advisor:    You've uncovered an ancient laboratory in there? Lith's visions must have been true, you must inform Zura! 
Advisor:    Don't take too long. As soon as the last Valc forces arrive here, we'll prepare for our final attack. 
Advisor:    The curse of war technology... I knew they'd eventually learn how our weapons work, but not this quickly... 
Advisor:    You have completed your task? Go ahead and tell Breaza, I'll be all ears. 
Advisor:    We need that powder by the time reinforcements arrive. Time is short, sergeant, get moving. 
Advisor:    You've made progress with the investigation? Report to Breaza right away! 
Advisor:    With the forest group missing, our flank is exposed. Act quickly, Halfblood. Act with tact. 
Advisor:    The campaign was a disaster... failed siege, subverted Forge Elementals, cutoff logistics... no retreat, no way forward. 
Advisor:    Demons laughed at our forces from behind their walls. So many of our sisters have fallen to their artillery... 
Advisor:    We've managed to regroup here. I'd almost say we have retreated if we weren't still in the middle of enemy territory. 
Advisor:    Slaughtering the cultist mansion has bought us some breathing space. I am quite impressed by your might, Halfblood. 
Advisor:    Demons are a plague. They corrupt everything, growing stronger. Yes... their numbers always grow. Ours don't... 
Advisor:    The supplies dwindle by the day. If we don't break through soon, we'll simply be overwhelmed. Yes, we must strike... 
Advisor:    Daring plans and ideas... if only they were worth as much in the midst of battle as they were at the strategy table. 
Advisor:    Our ancestral blood is strong. But is strength and honour enough to deal with such a treacherous adversary?... Hmh... 
Advisor:    Even the weakest warg is dangerous when cornered... yes... a small force could reach farther than an army... 
Advisor:    Every race has a home. We sought peace and shelter below the earth, but fate has brought the battlefield back to us. 
Reaver Tiati:    Good luck regrouping with the sapper team. Wish I could join you, but Breaza wants me to stay back here. 
Reaver Tiati:    You've found something down there, haven't you? Zura's been boiling to hear back from you. 
Reaver Tiati:    If Lith's visions are accurate, the ruins might shed some light on Nithriel's big plan. 
Reaver Tiati:    You can't seem to escape the fighting, can you? Get your rest, I'll wake you up if something happens. 
Reaver Tiati:    The demons have created a new weapon using our tech? This is bad news, you must inform Breaza! 
Reaver Tiati:    Blue Baron meeting with Nithriel... two praaks with one spike. We can't miss this opportunity. 
Reaver Tiati:    You found the captives? I'm sure Breaza will want to know what happened. 
Reaver Tiati:    Damn it, more sisters in peril. I'd help you investigate, but I can barely stand with all these wounds. 
Reaver Tiati:    I followed you through Nithriel's portal, hoping I could put a quick spike between her eyes, but she got away... 
Reaver Tiati:    I could barely sneak my way up here. Cultists moved back into the towns that got run through the blade weeks ago. 
Reaver Tiati:    No wonder no messenger could reach back to Valc. Even the paths cleared by our army are now held by demons. 
Reaver Tiati:    I told Breaza all about Valc's siege. Can't say she was expecting any good news, but morale has taken a big hit. 
Reaver Tiati:    If only we could link up with Valc... we'd have one final chance to land an unexpected blow against the demons. 
Reaver Tiati:    I've seen what the cultists are capable of. If we fail, these fanatics will have free reign over the underground. 
Reaver Tiati:    I'm sorry for slowing you down back in Valc, but seeing you return home so suddenly made me suspicious. 
Reaver Tiati:    Good thing I was there for you back at the lab, huh? That bitch Lith almost turned you into sludge. 
Crystal Curator:    The Seed seems important, but we still have to retrieve the Disk. Let us prepare for battle. 
Crystal Curator:    You've discovered an ancient elven vault!? Fascinating! Zura is burning to hear about it! 
Crystal Curator:    Look out for strange devices. Who knows what technological wonder lies dormant in these ruins... 
Crystal Curator:    I am relieved to see that our forces still hold against the demon menace. The Division lives on. 
Crystal Curator:    Nithriel is a fool! Her reckless actions have put the entire underground world in danger. 
Crystal Curator:    Perhaps the Elf does want to destroy us all. She is in league with the demons, after all... 
Crystal Curator:    Without the Disk, the crystals are starting to destabilize. Have you seen the lightning storm? 
Crystal Curator:    If we merge with Valc's remnants in time, we may have a chance to restore the balance. 
Crystal Curator:    I was nearing the end of my curation mandate before chaos broke loose. So many Lancers have perished... 
Crystal Curator:    A Curator must tend to the Crystal Heart. We form a strong bond with the crystals... I can feel their pain. 
Crystal Curator:    The Iron Division was founded upon the discovery of the Disk. It taught us the secrets of crystal technology. 
Eraanthe:    Don't pester me now, I'm preparing for the assault. Don't you have an errand to run or something? 
Eraanthe:    What are you staring at, you uncouth blue oaf? What do you want? Make it quick, I'm not famous for my patience. 
Eraanthe:    Your mother has contracted me to take your place in the campaign... not that I don't have my own reasons to join. 
Eraanthe:    The core of Hell is surrounded by a foul and corruptive energy that only allows demon-bloods to pass through unscathed. 
Eraanthe:    Trusting a full blooded demon is insanity. That's why only us halfblooded bastards can be counted on to do this right. 
Eraanthe:    Demons are chaos incarnate. They would kill and pillage each other if it wasn't for their Icon to keep them in line. 
Eraanthe:    The Icon is the highest and strongest demon of all. It is said that one raises from the nether every thousand years. 
Eraanthe:    The current Icon is known as as the Blue Baron. He's caused me so much grief... but I survived. Now I want revenge. 
Eraanthe:    Cut the head off and let the body stumble and fall. A swift strike at the Blue Baron for a thousand years of peace. 
Eraanthe:    Your mother wants to go all in. Pierce the veils of Hell and slay the Icon. A bold intention, albeit a foolish one. 
Eraanthe:    The Baron is a master Psionic Demon. He deceives like no other. It will take more than orcish might to bring him down. 
Eraanthe:    Don't even think about getting in my way, you narrow sighted brute. Only I have the power to challenge the Blue Baron. 
Eraanthe:    Look at you, you can't even use magic and you're supposed to be Breaza's champion? Pathetic! I am our only hope. 
High Priest Jaromir:    So, the final battle is about to begin. There is no better moment to pray than right now. 
High Priest Jaromir:    I hope you have discovered something worthwhile down there. Tell Chieftain Zura of your findings. 
High Priest Jaromir:    I see you've gathered a few bruises from the minotaur town. I'm sure a nap will help. 
High Priest Jaromir:    Back from the dead? Not many of us could cheat fate during that terrible siege, lass. Be grateful. 
H.Priest Jaromir:    Our Lord has fallen in battle, leaving the future of Icepeak on my shoulders - a humble servant of Stone. 
H.Priest Jaromir:    The news about our homes has dealt another mighty blow against us. I grieve with you, lass, keep strong. 
H.Priest Jaromir:    The dwarves slain in Icepeak were either elders or sick. Aye, the Cult truly has no shame, nor honour... 
H.Priest Jaromir:    Fight with valor, lass. The Stone will remember our deeds and shelter our bones in its layers of history. 
H.Priest Jaromir:    A long abandoned dwarven city lies close, to the south of us. Aye... a reminder of our long lost glory. 
H.Priest Jaromir:    A city shows its true greatness long after the inhabitants have perished. Build your walls well, lass. 
H.Priest Jaromir:    The perfidious demons want to keep us down in the dumps. In this dark moment we must steel our faith. 
Minotaur Lord Murguth:    I'd like to be left alone now, Bonebreaker. I must meditate on the upcoming battle. 
Minotaur Lord Murguth:    Your search has beared fruit? That is good news, let Breaza know of your findings. 
Min. Lord Murguth:    They have mutilated my ancestral home with their factory... this is unforgivable. 
Min. Lord Murguth:    The demons must have claimed many dwarven secrets after the old wars, judging by their machines. 
Min. Lord Murguth:    With the knowledge of crystals stolen from your kind, who knows what new weapons they will forge? 
Min. Lord Murguth:    You faced the demons bravely and cleansed them from our town. You have my herd's gratitude. 
Minotaur Lord Murguth:    Look for gates adorned with iron bull heads... the ruby pedestals should be close to them. 
Minotaur Lord Murguth:    You're welcome among us, Halfblood. I can tell your worth from the fire burning in your eyes. 
Min. Lord Murguth:    The Minotaur Lords have perished in battle. I was but the High Pyromancer... now I lead the herd. 
Min. Lord Murguth:    Hearing about Valc's invasion makes my blood boil. We all have suffered many losses. 
Min. Lord Murguth:    We put a lot of faith in the Forge Elementals to lead us through the fiery pits of Hell... foolish. 
Min. Lord Murguth:    We may be masters of Fire, but we have underestimated the native affinity that demons have to it. 
Min. Lord Murguth:    The chaos scum have somehow syphoned into the Forge Elementals' fiery cores and corrupted them. 
Min. Lord Murguth:    Fire is a weak weapon against demons. Make no mistake, even the blue and purple ones resist it. 
Min. Lord Murguth:    You orcs know how to wield an axe. You fight with great might, and that's why I respect you. 
Warlord Grund:    I heard we have guests from Valc, mh? Send Zura my regards, I'm still too busy down here. 
Warlord Grund:    No hard feelings, sergeant. When we couldn't find your body we assumed you had deserted us. 
Warlord Grund:    I don't need to take Tiati's word. I can see myself that you've been through some shit... 
Warlord Grund:    Good call reclaiming the Magic Ward and cutting the cultists off. That's what saved Valc. 
Warlord Grund:    I'm the only Warlord who survived the siege. I was behind the line, handling logistics. 
Warlord Grund:    They said I was too old to be on the front, and here I am, having outlived the others... 
Warlord Grund:    We all have our duties and burdens pressing down our shoulders. Carry out your orders. 
Warlord Grund:    Breaza is the boss now. She's ordered me to stay here and interrogate the prisoners. 
Warlord Grund:    Tiati said you did well leading your squad, back in Valc. A skill we're in need of. 
Warlord Grund:    We're preparing for the assault, sergeant. You have your orders, let us be. 
Warlord Grund:    Has your mission been successful, warrior? Go ahead and debrief with Zura. 
(You pet the warg)
(You scratch the warg)
(You pet the warg)
Warg:    *Growls softly*
(You scratch the warg)
Warg:    *Sniffs lazily*
(You pet the warg)
Warlord Grund:    She's a war machine, not a house pet, sergeant. Keep your hands where they belong. 
Witch Chieftain Zura:    I believe your task is clear. Leave us be now, we have an assault plan to finalize. 
Witch Chieftain Zura:    My, my, my... turns out Lith's fevered visions were true. Let me take a look at this baby...
The Seed of Corruption, hmm? This will be invaluable if we want to understand this alien organism-
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    Combat it, Zura. If we want to combat it.
Witch Chieftain Zura:    Of course, my dear. You don't think I'd want to weaponize it against our enemy, hmm?
Advisor:    Regardless of what we'll do with it, we have other matters pressing us right now, ladies.
Crystal Curator:    Yes, we must focus on recovering the Disk. Nithriel could depart to Hell any moment now. 
Grand Earth Mother Breaza:    Of course. And I'm afraid there will be no rest for you this time, Zan.
Advisor:    As you have noticed, the Valc forces have finally arrived, and we're preparing for the main assault.
A few hours ago, we've sent a sapper team to prepare the sabotage of the flame towers warding the enemy gates.
They headed out to the mines to the north, in search of an ideal place to tunnel around the demon town.
Unfortunately, the demons have somehow figured out our plan and ambushed them, blowing up the main access tunnel.
Grand E. M. Breaza:    We need you to find an alternative path into the mine and see what happened to the sappers.
Lord Murguth claims that the minotaur town has a path connected to the mines. 'tis a good place to start looking.
Once you find a way in, use the hell powder barrels our sappers were carrying to blow through the town's side wall. 
Advisor:    The distant explosion will be our signal to move, so make haste and disable the flame towers immediately.
Grand E. M. Breaza:    It is a dangerous task, but you're the only one I can entrust with fulfilling it.
Don't let us perish in the fire before we can even draw steel, Zan. We're counting on you. Earth guide your path!
Earth Mother:    Worry not, Breaza. We shall see this mission through. Earth protect you! 
Fixer:    I, uhh... I'll make sure to cover her back, Breaza! Take care! 
Witch Chieftain Zura:    Our journey here was surprisingly smooth. I believe it's you who cleared the path, yes? 
Witch Chieftain Zura:    Captain Dura is marching with Valc's remnants as we speak. We're expecting them tomorrow. 
Witch Chieftain Zura:    The slime corruption is not just a disease... a disease doesn't think. This does. 
Witch Chieftain Zura:    I'm concerned with how easily Nithriel managed to turn my adjunct into her puppet. 
Witch Chieftain Zura:    It's clear that the Elf needed someone with knowledge of crystal technology. One of us. 
Witch Chieftain Zura:    The slime Golems are mere warnings of what this dark parasite is capable of creating. 
Witch Chieftain Zura:    I bear traces of corruption thanks to Lith, but I can suppress it with the right potions. 
Witch Chieftain Zura:    I'm not sure what Nithriel plans to do with the Disk. But I'm sure that we must stop her. 
Warlord Grund:    Leave the pussycat alone, she's still recovering after the last interrogation, heh heh... 
Hellblaze:    *Growls* 
Hellblaze:    *Growls angrily* 
Hellblaze:    ...curse...Orc! 
Hellblaze:    ...master...free...me... 
Hellblaze:    ...arrrgh! 
Maid:    I'm almost done here, Zan, just a few more minutes. Umm, I think Breaza is looking for you. 
Maid:    Your room isn't ready Zan, I still have plenty of cleaning to do. 
Maid:    If you don't mind, I'm working as hard as I can, I don't have time to chat! 
Maid:    Look, honey, this will take a while, can't you like go for a walk or something? 
Maid:    Can you stop bugging me? I swear it won't make the cleaning go any faster. 
Maid:    *Rolls her eyes over* 
Maid:    Oh, you found my goggles? Hmm, know what? Why don't you keep them? The cellar can wait a while longer. 
Maid:    Dust everywhere. And I told the Earth Mothers to be more careful when quaking up the caves. 
Maid:    What a mess... if only they were as good at cleaning after themselves as they are at drinking. 
Maid:    I have to clean the cellar too... I just can't find my goggles. Where could they have vanished? 
Maid:    Hope the goggles are coming in handy. Your task is more important than me cleaning cellars, after all. 
Maid:    You and Tiati better keep that room clean. Don't you dare munch on any food in bed! 
Maid:    Sweetie, I'm really busy, I'm sure there's plenty of others here looking for a chatting partner. 
Earth Mother Bendi:    Oh, you've found a Spirit Gem? How delightful, I shall recharge your crown at once!
There it is! If you happen upon any other Spirit Gem, bring it to me and I'll recharge the crown with it! 
Earth Mother Bendi:    Oh, another Spirit Gem? How delightful, I shall recharge your crown in a moment!
There! May it shield you from all the Psi Demons and their wretched Mentalists! 
Earth Mother Bendi:    Found another Spirit Gem? But your crown is already at full charge, I can't do anymore than that! 
Earth Mother Bendi:    I took a look at this enchanted crown you were carrying. Very interesting artifact, I must say!
Sadly, it seems to have been depleted of energy. I could charge it back for you, if you could bring me a Spirit Gem. 
E.M. Bendi:    Not many artifacts can protect against mind magic. No Armor Amulet or Elemental Ring will stop a mind blast. 
E.M. Bendi:    The Cult has a large sect dedicated to mind magic, and worship Psionic Demons. The Blue Baron is one of them. 
E.M. Bendi:    If we march against the Demons, this Psi Crown would be invaluable. The Baron can fry your brain in a moment. 
E.M. Bendi:    This one Bear tried to use her buckler against a Mentalist. Good thing his magic fizzled against her poor mind. 
E.M. Bendi:    The smarter you are, the harder you snap. I suppose us mages should fear psionics more than you fighter types. 
E.M. Bendi:    The Self Worship practiced by the Cult has revealed other kinds of magic than those of our Elemental Gods. 
Witch Brewer:    Sorry, no new healing pots. The Earth Mothers are suddenly in need of even more mana... 
Witch Brewer:    Aww, you need me to check your recipe? Maybe you should've thought about it before breaking my stuff! 
Witch Brewer:    Huh? You found a recipe? Let me have a look. Hm. Hmmm... let's give it a try then...
There it is... quite a powerful brew. No clue what it does, just hope it doesn't turn your kidney into stone. 
Witch Brewer:    I'll have to work overtime thanks to you! Get lost. 
Witch Brewer:    What's this, you need healing? I hope you die a slow death! 
Witch Brewer:    Help yourself to these potions if you need. They'll get you back in fighting shape in no time! 
Witch Brewer:    With the Earth Mothers busy keeping the crystals functional, I have to handle the healing by myself. 
Witch Brewer:    I have to make mana potions right now... don't suppose you warriors have any use for them, do you? 
Witch Brewer:    Ugh, my arms hurt. I've been stirring this pot all day long. Wish I had an apprentice or something. 
Witch Brewer:    The fumes are making me so dizzy. I've sniffed so much mana I might start shooting fireballs soon. 
Witch Brewer:    Hmm, was it three salamander tails or two?... Just pulling your leg, you think I'm THAT green? 
Witch Brewer:    Hey! Watch what you're breaking, that's hours of my work gone! 
Witch Brewer:    What the fuck?! Stop breaking my stuff!!! 
Witch Brewer:    Okay dipshit, you wanna screw us over?! Fine, no more healing for you! 
Witch Brewer:    You fucking dipshit... I'm not going to forget this anytime soon! 
Earth Mother Bendi:    Can you practice your might on something else please? 
Minotaur Pyromancer:    Is this the time to horse around, half-orc? 
Workshop Boss:    This new gun you've uncovered is quite a piece of work. Wish I had more time to study it. 
Workshop Boss:    You got the ore?  Damn, big girl!   Here, we recovered some ammo boxes. I know it ain't
much, but I'm sure the Reavers will be happy to hear you've earned them a better fighting chance. 
Workshop Boss:    You got the ore? Damn, big girl! Here, we recovered this bracer. I know it ain't
much, but I'm sure the Reavers will be happy to hear you've earned them a better fighting chance. 
I'll take the ore to Hectus when he's done working, doncha worry about it. Thanks for the help. 
Workshop Boss:    Hmm?... Look, I don't have time for your diving suit project, go ask Hectus about it! 
Look, I appreciate the help, but let me be now, I can't work with all these distractions! 
Workshop Boss:    What do you want, big girl? Can't you see I'm busy? Urgh, I'm trying to think here! 
Workshop Boss:    ...first the power crystals start losing energy for no reason and now this. Ugh! Can't I catch a break?! 
Workshop Boss:    This Reaver squad got caught in a bad spot and had to ditch their Spike Guns... now I have to replace them. 
Workshop Boss:    The current Spike Gun model has a spike heater... but that doesn't work with regular steel parts, no... 
Workshop Boss:    *Mumbles to herself* ...yeah, only Dark Iron can resist heat conduction... no way around this design... 
Workshop Boss:    Look, can ya buzz off? Unless you have like six lumps of Dark Iron in your pockets, you're useless here. 
Hectus:    You need me to put together a dwarven diving suit? An odd request. Let me see what I can do about it... 
Hectus:    You filled the tank? Good. Let me see what I can do about the suit... 
It's an old relic but I cleaned and fixed the important bits. I also stitched the suits together to fit your size.
I hope you have the means to refill the air tank. Something this old will leak a lot more air than it should. 
Hectus:    You need me to put together a diving suit? Hmm, fill that air tank first, we need to make sure it won't leak. 
Hectus:    *Squints* ...you look like you could use a proper axe, warrior. I even have this enchanted scroll waiting
for the right blade. If you can bring me eight lumps of Iron Ore, I'll forge a weapon worthy of your arms, Half-Orc. 
Hectus:    You return with the ore? Good, I will start working on your axe right away...
It is done. A Great Axe worthy of you, Halfblood. Wield it proudly.
If you bring more iron I'll trade you gold for it. 
Hectus:    There you go.
(You trade a lump of Iron Ore for ten gold coins) 
Hectus:    Good, you found some ore. Pick one of the ammo types you want and I'll pack it for you here. 
Hectus:    Don't distract me, Halfblood. One wrong strike with this Fire Hammer and we'll both explode into bits. 
Hectus:    I've worked for the Iron Division for decades. You orcs fight with honour. I know my axes live in worthy hands. 
Hectus:    Every blade I craft bears a fraction of my soul. The steel rages with my fury when slicing through demons. 
Hectus:    The campaign has been gruesome, and it will worsen, but the enemy has yet to see the last drop of our blood. 
Hectus:    Maybe I will get to see Valc again... I have faith in our warriors. Even now, we can still break the demons. 
Hectus:    I haven't slept in a while but the war surrounding us doesn't wait. I will work for as long as it demands. 
Hectus:    Well met, orc. Our supplies are running low, but if you bring in any iron, you can exchange it for ammo. 
Hectus:    Here, pick 'em up.
(You trade a lump of ore for two Spike Mags) 
Hectus:    You only have dark iron? I believe the Workshop Boss needs it more than me right now. 
Hectus:    This ammo isn't free, Orc. You can only trade for it with ore. 
Hectus:    Here you go.
(You trade a lump of ore for three Fragfire Cans) 
Hectus:    You only have dark iron? I believe the Workshop Boss needs it more than me right now. 
Hectus:    This ammo isn't free, Orc. You can only trade for it with ore. 
Hectus:    Here, come grab 'em.
(You trade a lump of ore for two Boltmags) 
Hectus:    You only have dark iron? I believe the Workshop Boss needs it more than me right now. 
Hectus:    This ammo isn't free, Orc. You can only trade for it with ore. 
Hectus:    Here, take them.
(You trade a lump of ore for two Boxes of Acid Potions) 
Hectus:    You only have dark iron? I believe the Workshop Boss needs it more than me right now. 
Hectus:    This ammo isn't free, Orc. You can only trade for it with ore. 
Hectus:    Here, come pick it up.
(You trade a lump of ore for a Box of Toxic Potions) 
Hectus:    You only have dark iron? I believe the Workshop Boss needs it more than me right now. 
Hectus:    This ammo isn't free, Orc. You can only trade for it with ore. 
Shady Fixer:    Hey, what are you doing? Leave that alone! 
Shady Fixer:    Nosy oaf! I hope you haven't touched any of my stuff! 
Shady Fixer:    Psst. Hey you. 
Shady Fixer:    You found a lockbox? And it's full of loot? Let me take a look!
Got it! Let's see what's inside...
Some gold... my payment, I presume.
...a lump of iron ore? Okay.
...my, this must be worth something. But I suppose you want your share, mmh?... Fine, it's yours.
That's all. I don't suppose you wanna keep the box too, do you? 
Shady Fixer:    You look like a capable fighter. And a capable fighter knows the need to be well equipped...
I happen to have this spare pair of Dark Vision Goggles, and it can be yours for a measly ten gold coins. 
Shady Fixer:    Come on, babe, ten gold and you won't struggle seeing in the dark ever again! 
Shady Fixer:    There, we're starting to get along. Now, see these two sentries here? A hundred gold. 
Shady Fixer:    These sentries are best buddies. I'll even unpack them for you, for only a hundred. 
Shady Fixer:    I love the sight of a fat purse. Give me a sec, I'll unpack the turrets for you.
They'll serve you well. But not as well as what I have here... a Bag of Holding, babe. Three
hundred gold. A bit steep, sure, but think about all that extra ammo it will let you carry. 
Shady Fixer:    You really want that Bag of Holding, don't you? Three hundred gold, sweets. 
Shady Fixer:    *Gasps* You're a rich orc, Zan. My type of orc. You've bought out all my special merch,
but I can keep selling you Vials of Healing for ten gold each.   They'll keep you alive like nothing else. 
Shady Fixer:    Come now, can't spare a mere ten gold for a vial that can save your life? 
Shady Fixer:    Here you go, babe, stay healthy! 
Lady Ingrim, Queen of the Icepeak Dwarves, at your service. Here... this should get you back on your feet. 
Lady Ingrim:    Sorry, no drinks for the praak. 
Lady Ingrim:    Found a recipe? Hmm, it doesn't involve any alcohol... maybe the witch brewer can have a look? 
Lady Ingrim:    Fine, I'll take that recipe off of you. Here, drink something that won't potentially kill you. 
Lady Ingrim:    Done exploring our ancient town? Here, have a drink in the memory of my ancestors... 
Lady Ingrim:    Our fate rests on your shoulders, warrior. Earn us victory and I'll let you drink like a king. 
Lady Ingrim:    So, you're leading the attack against the demons now? I'm afraid I have no drink for that.
I'd give you a poison capsule, but you don't look like someone who would get captured. 
Lady Ingrim:    Off to the icy region? Something to keep you warm, coming right up. 
Lady Ingrim:    Going to the minotaur's town? Here... you need to stay well hydrated. And sober. 
Lady Ingrim:    Since Jaromir is commanding our dwarves, I had to find a way to make myself useful around here. 
Lady Ingrim:    I hail from the Brewer Guild. Before I became Queen, I used to be a renowned tavernkeep. 
Lady Ingrim:    My family has successfully run multiple taverns, even long after our empire had collapsed. 
Lady Ingrim:    Icepeak is a mere miniature of our past glory. We had great hopes of repopulating our lost towns... 
Lady Ingrim:    My husband fell during the final siege. I swore to live long enough to see him avenged. 
Lady Ingrim:    I'm afraid I don't know much about fighting. Only about getting others to fight for me. 
Dwarf Militia:    Mmm? You have a locked box? Aye, I can help ya with that, let me have a look...
Opened. Aight, let's take a peek...
A big ol' pile o' gold!...
...a lump of iron ore? Hmm.
...by Stone's Hammer! A giant ruby! Masterfully cut too...
That's all there is. I'll keep the lockbox as payment if ya don't mind. What a fine piece of work it is... 
Dwarf Militia:    We've lost nearly all our siege weapons to these bleeding traitorous Forge Elementals! 
Dwarf Militia:    The Carpenter Guild toiled hard to build all those ballistae and mangonels... and for what? 
Dwarf Militia:    Aye, I'm a proud member of the Carpenter Guild. Nobody shapes the wood like we do, lassie. 
Dwarf Militia:    I trained as a locksmith, putting locks on chests and cabinets before this war. *Sighs* 
Dwarf Militia:    Ya have to adapt, lass. Today you're tinkering with locks, tomorrow you're making a catapult. 
Dwarf Militia:    The campaign has brought us much suffering, aye, but we all want to avenge our fallen brothers. 
Dwarf Militia:    Bonebreaker! C'mere! 
Dwarf Militia:    Hey, someone's been askin' about ya. Check downstairs. 
Minotaur Axeman:    Stay sharp. We crushed most of the nearby Cult settlements but these caves are ever dangerous. 
Minotaur Axeman:    Demons can gate across short distances here, but the Earth Mothers protect our camp from it. 
Minotaur Axeman:    I'm supposed to watch over Breaza at all times. Nobody lays a finger on her on my watch. 
Minotaur Axeman:    I serve the Division with pride. Without you, us cave minotaurs wouldn't have survived this far. 
Minotaur Pyromancer:    Hmm? You've found a scroll case inside our long abandoned town? Let me have it...
A fine magic seal... it makes me yearn for our ancestors' secrets. Well, let us see what's inside...
...a true wealth of knowledge. Here, these scrolls will be of use to you... the rest, not so much.
Be wary, as the bursts of exploding flames can easily hurt you too. Use the knowledge of the pyromancers wisely. 
Minotaur Pyromancer:    My entire life was dedicated to studying fire magic. I've even trained some of your mages. 
Minotaur Pyromancer:    Murguth is the greatest Pyromancer alive. He leads us now that the Lords have fallen. 
Minotaur Pyromancer:    There's an ancient minotaur town nearby, dating from the ages of the Dwarven Wars. 
Minotaur Pyromancer:    I dream of uncovering our forgotten libraries. Imagine all the knowledge locked inside. 
Earth Mother:    *Chanting* 
Dwarf Shieldguard:    Watch yer back out there, lass, we're sitting deep within enemy territory! 
Dwarf Shieldguard:    If ya run into any trouble outside, rush back 'ere, I'll hold the gate open for ya. 
Dwarf Shieldguard:    I wager there's still some goods hidden inside the pillaged houses nearby. 
Dwarf Shieldguard:    Don't set off on a road longer than your quiver can last, my pa used to say. 
Dwarf Shieldguard:    Good hunting!
Dwarf Shieldguard:    Watch yer back, lass!
Dwarf Shieldguard:    Stone pave yer path!
Dwarf Shieldguard:    Travel safe, lassie! 
Dwarf Shieldguard:    Welcome back, lassie!
Dwarf Shieldguard:    Found what ye were lookin' fer?
Dwarf Shieldguard:    Good to see ya in one piece!
Dwarf Shieldguard:    Come in, gate's open fer ya! 
Bear Warrior:    Keeping me company, sarge? It does get a bit lonely up here alright. 
Bear Warrior:    So Valc was swarmed by cultists after we left? Slithering bastards, how did they plan so well? 
Bear Warrior:    Tiati said you slayed a huge Pit Lord! If I ever return home I better see his skull at the tavern. 
Bear Warrior:    So many sisters have fallen in battle... the Lancers and Warlords... how can we recover from this? 
Bear Warrior:    Weren't we supposed to get a report from the forest squad today?
Reaver:    I bet the dome rain has bogged them down... 
Bear Warrior:    Scouts say the lightning storm is getting worse... what if the caves get flooded?
Reaver:    If demons keep attacking we'll be dead long before that happens. 
Bear Warrior:    Glad to have you here with us, Bonebreaker. Stay a while, warm yourself by the fire. 
Bear Warrior:    We had to fall back into these caves after our defeat. Breaza hopes to strike from a new angle now. 
Bear Warrior:    Whew, the way you razed that Cult mansion from inside was crazy! You beat a weeks long siege to it! 
Bear Warrior:    Since we don't need to block the mansion anymore, we can strengthen the south flank and buy time. 
Reaver:    A lightning storm is brewing in the Crystal Dome. Breaza says it's why the crystals started to fade. 
Reaver:    The storm is unusual. The forest part leading up to the southern Cult fortress is laden with rain. 
Reaver:    At least that patch of vegetation won't die so soon. Still, it won't stop our impending starvation. 
Reaver:    The odds are stacked against us... the siege, the storm, the demons... pick the flavor of your death. 
Fixer:    Excuse me? We could use that ammo too, you know?! 
Fixer:    There's a mine just north of us. Murguth says it belonged to the minotaurs before the Cult claimed it. 
Fixer:    Scouts say they found human skeletons at the entrance to the mine... but it's not us who killed them. 
Fixer:    Word is, a few cultists defected in the wake of our forces. Turns out they're not all blind fanatics. 
Fixer:    With ammo supplies dwindling, we'll have to adapt and improvise... glad I used to work as a scavenger. 
Reaver:    I don't mean any disrespect, but I'm not in the mood for chit-chat, sergeant. 
Reaver:    It's stressful enough having to keep my eyes peeled for a demon strike, I don't need any distractions. 
Reaver:    If I make it out of this in one piece, I'll crash into the first bed I find and sleep for a whole week. 
Reaver:    *Sighs and rubs her eyes* 
Bear Warrior:    Stay clear of the road leading to the right! The Cult has set up a barricade around the corner. 
Bear Warrior:    Demons have been raiding us regularly. They are testing our defenses for a bigger attack... 
Bear Warrior:    The gates to the demon port town are defended by powerful flame hurling towers. Stay away! 
Bear Warrior:    I don't know how much longer we can hold. What if they just send a large army to crush us? 
Bear Warrior:    Sorry for throwing you in jail, Zan. Grund got us all worked up over your bullshit desertion. 
Bear Warrior:    Now that the mansion is no longer a threat I got transferred to the defense line here. 
Bear Warrior:    I'd love to hear the story of how you've returned, but I need to stay focused. 
Bear Warrior:    Remind me to buy you one large pint if we make it out of this mess. Or a dozen. My treat. 
Bear Warrior:    We've searched the fortress and found some pretty good intel. This Nithriel chick is up to something. 
Bear Warrior:    The bastards have tortured a Reaver to death! She was strong, though, didn't crack a word. 
Bear Warrior:    Someone called the Spirit Mistress was in charge here. She got what was coming for her. 
Bear Warrior:    You really got them riled up here, I'll give you that. We have quite some cleanup to do. 
Bear Warrior:    The fortress is clear, and we've also secured the stolen supplies. Feel free to grab what's left. 
Bear Warrior:    Heh. We've besieged them for weeks and you broke through in only a few hours. Not bad, big girl. 
Bear Warrior:    The cultists were unusually well organized here. I bet it's the demons who whipped them into shape. 
Bear Warrior:    With this position captured, we've secured a pretty damn safe route for a messenger to reach Valc. 
Fixer:    It's so nice to see you again, Zan! That was quite an adventure, wasn't it? 
Fixer:    I was ordered to stay here and guard the portal. This place is giving me chills, literally. 
Fixer:    This dwarven stone garden is really pretty, but it just gets so boring watching it all day. 
Fixer:    Nothing happens here... although I can hear weird echoes coming from those gates every now and then. 
Fixer:    This place must be centuries old. I bet priest Jaromir's ancestors used to live here once. 
Fixer:    Don't you think I'm wasting my time here? I bet they just sent me back here to stay out of trouble. 
Fixer:    Hey... I don't even think they'd notice if I left... and a hardass like you could keep me safe! 
Fixer:    Hey... I don't even think they'd notice if I left... mmm, no, I should probably stay here... 
Fixer:    Yes, you could vouch for me if they complain, right? Cool, I'm ready to tag alongside you then! 
Fixer:    Z-Zan!? O-oh, my, I almost shot you! 
Reaver:    Thanks for freeing us, Zan... I was next on the chopping block, you saved my skin. 
Reaver:    They took one of our sisters for interrogation. I still can't get her screams out of my head. 
Reaver:    Us Reavers are trained to resist pain, but these self mutilating freaks are on another level. 
Reaver:    They couldn't get anything from us. I heard them talking about bringing in a succubus. Heh. 
Reaver:    ... 
Reaver:    *Stares into the distance* 
Reaver:    ...look, thanks for saving us... but I want to be left alone. 
Reaver:    Please... I've lost a good friend. Leave me be. 
Bear Warrior:    Hail, Bonebreaker! The earth drinks well where you set foot, you are a worthy orc! 
Bear Warrior:    I can't wait to listen to the bards sing about you breaking us free, hah! 
Bear Warrior:    This war is far from over. And now that I'm free I can carve my name into demonic skulls again! 
Bear Warrior:    You're a stout warrior, sarge. I'll make sure to drink with you once this is over. 
Witch:    We've secured the area. That was a thrilling prison break, thanks for assisting us. 
Witch:    We recovered our gear and took over what the cultists had here. Spoils of war, mm? 
Witch:    Pillaging cultist forts never gets tiresome. Especially when they have a large kitchen. 
Witch:    You should check the fortress for any hidden paths, there might be some goods stashed away. 
Bear Warrior:    Everything's in order, ma'am, we're holding strong! 
Bear Warrior:    We're ready for any counter-attack, let them come! 
Bear Warrior:    Demons can teleport over short distances here. You never know when they'll jump you. 
Bear Warrior:    Keep an eye out for glowing pentagrams. They're always a bad sign... 
Bear Warrior:    What a prison break! And we got away almost unscratched. You're a beast, sarge! 
Bear Warrior:    Breaza ordered us to hold here. I hate seeing this place, but orders are orders. 
Bear Warrior:    The cultists had well organized defenses. Well, not well enough to stop you! 
Bear Warrior:    I miss Valc... I don't even know if we'll get to see it again. Fuck this place. 
Fixer:    We've recovered the hell powder barrels from the minotaur town, thanks for securing them. 
Fixer:    We'll use the powder to tunnel around the flame towers protecting the Demon Town's gate. 
Fixer:    The mine just north of here will allow us to get closer to a side wall, then breach in. 
Fixer:    I hope Breaza adds you to our sapper team once the operation begins. I'd feel a lot safer. 
Witch:    After the invasion's end we had to clean up all the dark slime the Cult had spread in Valc. 
Witch:    This isn't a simple blight, it's a living organism. Zura even believes it's sentient. 
Witch:    Zura is afflicted with the parasite. She's desperate to find a way to combat the corruption. 
Witch:    Our party left Valc to find prime slime samples. Soon after, we stumbled upon your messenger. 
Reaver:    Nice to see you, Zan, stay with us as long as you want, help yourself to some food. 
Reaver:    Valc is still a mess... it took us days upon days only to lay all the corpses to rest. 
Reaver:    So many of us perished... at this point I wonder if it's even worth rebuilding our town. 
Reaver:    Demons, death, war... it's so nice when you can just sit down and grill, forget about it all. 
Bear Warrior:    Good to see you alive and well, Bonebreaker! Your name is earning honour quickly! 
Bear Warrior:    We knew you defeated the warlock bitch when we saw her cultists scurrying away! 
Bear Warrior:    I still wonder - what made you return to Valc? You showed up right on time! 
Bear Warrior:    The demons and their human lackeys will feel every inch of our vengeance. Grrrh! 
Bear Warrior:    *Growls and pants* 
Bear Warrior:    ... 
Bear Warrior:    Well met, sergeant! Wanna train with me? 
Bear Warrior:    Feel the wrath of the Iron Division! Hrrargh!!! 
Captain Dura:    Earth's strength, Bonebreaker! At last, we're all here together, and we're thirsty for vengeance! 
Captain Dura:    We marched here like the wind when we heard about the survivors. We're longing for battle! 
Captain Dura:    Lancer Dendra remained back in Valc with those who haven't fully recovered from their wounds. 
Captain Dura:    This is our final chance to put an end to the demon menace. May the Gods guide our wrath! 
Captain Dura:    A sapper team was supposed to disable the flame towers at the gate, but they got ambushed. 
Captain Dura:    If we can't bring the towers down we'll have to go through an inferno to get past their walls. 
Captain Dura:    You have your orders, sergeant. Now excuse me, I have to prepare my squads for the assault. 
Captain Dura:    We shall not falter! For the Iron Division!
Orc Warriors:    *Cheers* 
Captain Dura:    For Valc! For our fallen sisters!
Orc Warriors:    *Cheers* 
Captain Dura:    Our axes shall be drenched in demon blood!
Orc Warriors:    *Cheers* 
Captain Dura:    Fight with pride! Fight with honour!
Orc Warriors:    *Cheers* 
Captain Dura:    We embrace death! The Earth will shelter our bones!
Orc Warriors:    *Cheers* 
Captain Dura:    We shall crush them under our boots! Demons will fear our name for centuries to come!
Orc Warriors:    *Cheers* 
Earth Mother:    Zan... Breaza is worried for your safety. She asked me to aid you, let us travel together. 
Earth Mother:    Let me know if you ever require healing. 
Earth Mother:    This cave leads on the right path, Priest Jaromir must have passed through already. 
Earth Mother:    Poor dwarves... they are beyond my powers now... 
Earth Mother:    This looks like the gate to the dwarf town. Priest Jaromir must be waiting for us inside. 
Witch:    Zan?! Over here!... demon scum have taken us by surprise, we barely made it out alive! 
Fixer:    We were 'bout to blow that wall to bits, but now that you're here, the honour is all yours. 
Witch:    I hope you're fully prepared. Once you press that handle, there will be no turning back. 
Fixer:    Fire in the hole! 
Fixer:    Breach! Go! Go! Go! 
Lord Igrutius:    The orcs are attacking! Take defensive positions you filthy thralls! 
Warlord Grund:    Earth's might, Bonebreaker, you got us past the gates! Hold your axes high, vengeance draws near!
