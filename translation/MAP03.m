Bear Warrior:    Sarge? What the hell is going on here?
We should stick together, ready when you are.
Tip: You can order companions to follow you or hold position by interacting with them (DEFAULT: E) 
Bear Warrior:    Looks like Dura's squad made it to the Forge, but the gate is closed. Gotta find another way. 
Bear Warrior:    Curse these scumbags! We shall avenge our sisters! 
Bear Warrior:    These bastards are everywhere! Let's hurry up, we can't let them take the Crystal Heart! 
This switch requires a Stone key to open the door. 
This switch requires an Iron key to open the door. 
The gate must be fully powered first. 
Bear Warrior:    Oh shit!!! 
Bear Warrior:    Look out! 
To VALC'S BARRACKS AND BATH HOUSE 
TO VALC'S PLAZA 
(The note looks like it was pinned on the nearby wall but got blown away onto the floor)
If any survivor gets here, we are holding up in the garrison so link up with us as soon as
you can.   Make sure to hail us before entering the courtyard, or we might open fire on
you. Oh, and if any of you cultist freaks can read this, come kiss our asses. -Cpt. Beza 
Captain Dura's Log - Day 239
Valc is under attack! Our crystal barriers must have fallen somehow, since the invading force is using
powerful magic portals to bypass our outer defenses! I have linked up with Captain Beza and the rest
of the garrison.  We are outnumbered, and we're barely holding the apartments.  We don't have enough
supplies to survive a siege,  so we have decided to split up...     I will take six Bear Warriors and rush to
aid the Lancers guarding the Crystal Heart, since that's our grand duty. The Plaza path is blocked so
our best shot is to move to the Forge and use the portal there to rally up with the Heart's Guardians.
Beza will stay here with the goblins and hold the barracks. Or at least try to slow the new waves down.
(A sentence has been added to the bottom, clearly written in haste by someone else. The ink hasn't dried.)
We ran out of ammo... it's not even fair... Beza is dead... I've nowhere to fall back now. Remember us. 
BATH HOUSE GATE POWER - SOUTH HALF 
(The parchments depict various sketches and schematics) 
'tis a shame I couldn't find you before you set off. The matters of the Underworld are
ever pressing me. I hope you're all well. It is about time you and your orc sisters went
to strike those chaotic savages.    Still,  as much as I like the scars,  try not to bring
back any fresh ones.  I will be watching this conflict carefully, but my resources are
stretched thin.   Speaking of, you forgot your sentry toy by the temple, I dropped it
in the bedroom.    P.S. You need to find a better place to hide your apartment key. -A. 
BATH HOUSE GATE POWER - NORTH HALF 
HOW DID YOU GET HERE? 
TO VALC'S GREAT FORGE 
All our Crushbows are now enchanted with Air Magic, courtesy to the Lancers and Earth Mothers.
This allows for deadly fast and accurate shots that pierce through all flesh and armor with ease.
Know that the magic force encasing the bolt dulls the explosion and fragmentation radius, but this
can certainly be used to our advantage at closer range.   No demon will withstand this raw power. 
Beza, if you or your scouts read this,  know that we have carved our way into the Forge.
The gates were open, so the cultists must have taken over the security posts in there.
We'll lock them down behind us, as we were just ambushed by a wave spawning right into
the depot here, and we can't risk getting flanked while pushing. We've loaded up on ammo
and potions but there's plenty supplies left around if you can get here. Good luck. - Dura 
BATH HOUSE OF THE ANCIENTS
RESTORED AND PRESERVED BY GRAND EARTH MOTHER BREAZA 
This wall remembers the western wing,  which was damaged beyond repair.
The recovered materials have been used to restore the other bath chambers. 
(The ledger holds records of supplies brought in from the Forge)
(Several blank pages at the back seem to have been ripped away) 
(The scroll feels warm, and after unrolling it you notice the ink is still fresh)
Zan!   What the hell are you doing here?   Weren't you supposed to be off with our main
force to strike at Hell's core?  Unless... Look, the demons are way up our ass right now.
I saw you coming through the vision globe,  and I think I know where you're headed...
Cultists are all over the place, and pretty much everyone got ambushed and killed in
mere moments. The Forge made no exception. An elven warlock seems to be leading this
assault. Tough bitch, went straight through the lower Plaza and used magic to cave in
the whole tunnel behind her...     The Lancers won't hold out forever,  and it's going to
be hard for us to reach them and assist. Dura went through with five other orcs, and
used the Forge portal to get there.   Or at least I think so, the warp looked unstable
to me.    She told me to get to Beza,  but I was too late,  so I am heading back to the
Crystal Heart now.  Hurry up to the Forge, I'll keep the portal open.   -   Reaver Tiati 
By the time it was discovered,  this corridor had completely succumbed to ruin.
The room beyond has been reconstructed from bare rock by the Earth Mothers' magic. 
Hey, can you go check out the vents behind the gym? The Bears keep telling me.
they hear some weird hissing noise.    Could be a fissure or perhaps some pests...
Don't forget to take a fragfire can with you, you might have some purging to do. 
Tip: You can deploy Sentry Turrets from your inventory.
Once deployed, you can move them around by interacting with them (DEFAULT: E) 
This door bears a strange feeling. The lock has a small axe symbol etched into it. 
This door requires a Stone key to open.
