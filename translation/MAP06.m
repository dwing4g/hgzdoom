Giant Nithriel 
Abhaoth:   ...ah...
Abhaoth:   ...now you remember... 
Abhaoth:   *Giggles* 
Abhaoth:   I should have you start from square one. 
Abhaoth:   Such a leap of faith... 
Abhaoth:   So eager... 
Abhaoth:   Woop- You almost missed it! 
Abhaoth:   Leap, you faithful hound! 
Abhaoth:   What's the matter? 
Abhaoth:   Confused? 
Abhaoth:   All you have to do... is open a simple door. 
Abhaoth:   No, no, no... you're going to play by *my* rules. 
Abhaoth:   *Giggles* 
Abhaoth:   Ah, yes... your memories are eluding you... 
Abhaoth:   Search for it... 
Abhaoth:   You have to find it. 
Abhaoth:   ...even if it means turning this place upside down. 
Abhaoth:  Warm. 
Abhaoth:  Warmer. 
Abhaoth:  Colder... 
Abhaoth:  There it is... 
Abhaoth:  ...burning. Red. Hot. 
Abhaoth:   The bridge ended there, genius- 
Abhaoth:   Curious are the corners of your mind... 
Abhaoth:   Yes... t'was a great battle... 
Abhaoth:   ...but it was treason that ultimately decided the victor... 
Abhaoth:   ...as I was saying. A great battle... but one decided by treason. 
Abhaoth:   You and the Iron Division have made it deep into enemy territory. 
Abhaoth:   You've carved your way towards the Hell Gates. Poised to strike at the very heart of the demons...
...little did you know that the siege was where it would all come to an end...
Maddened with corruption, your own Forge Elementals have turned against you... a sudden and deadly betrayal.
They struck down your siege weapons and supplies, as demons grinned from behind the dark gates...
By the time you repelled the attack, your fate had already been sealed. You could not advance, nor retreat.
Your only hope was to wait for the supply line to send help, but alas, the transports had met the same fate... 
Abhaoth:   You held up for a week. Then, you began to starve.
The demons had you in their claws now... they knew well your supplies would never come...
All they did was unleash the Cerberi upon you. Weakened as you were, you fought to the last breath...
All your hopes have been shattered... but your fate has yet to be fulfilled.
Come. It is time to reveal your purpose. 
Abhaoth:   Ever wondered why the orcs have accepted a half-demon like you among them? 
Abhaoth:   Your blood is the key to defeat the demons. 
Abhaoth:   The orcs needed you... 
Abhaoth:   ...but so do I. 
Abhaoth:   Nithriel is her name. She is behind the invasion of your stronghold.
Some of your sisters have assumed it was the demons who launched the attack but they
were wrong. Much like me, she is from the Nether. A place even demons fear to dare...
What your sisters *did* assume correctly, however, is that Nithriel received help from
within your ranks in order to launch such a precise attack. Just a month after you left town.
Who's the mole? No idea. But your... Lancers as you call them, have always protected
your city from magical attacks. Someone has tampered with the wards from the inside.
Your friend, Tiati, thinks you are involved. She thinks you are a coward who fled battle.
Such an example of bravery she is...
She knew about your return long before she let you know it... she was just... unsure.
She could have opened some doors for you... help you link up with the rest of the survivors.
Instead, she chose to keep you at distance, and leave notes behind. You cannot trust her...
Nithriel seeks a powerful artifact held by the Lancers. She has a grand scheme in mind, and
as we speak, her cultists are carving their way towards what you call the *Crystal Heart*...
It is here where this artifact lies, hidden by an ancient civilization that went extinct long ago.
...after all, you didn't imagine the orcs came up with crystal tech by themselves, did you?
What the artifact does is of no importance now. What matters is that I need you to stop her.
You do want your vengeance, don't you? Besides, you owe me your life...
Come now, step in. 
...what are you staring at? 
Come on, horndog, the future is at stake... 
I'm going to add a whole new set of scars when I get my claws on you... 
Abhaoth:   ...right. I saved your skin, remember? 
Abhaoth:   ...of course you don't. You did hit your head pretty hard. 
Abhaoth:   I dragged you away from battle a mere moment before you would have died. You're welcome.
Abhaoth:   For days you've crawled through dark caves, holding on to your final breath...
Abhaoth:   But you couldn't die now. You still have a mission to fulfill. 
Abhaoth:   ...but then the unpredictable happened. 
Abhaoth:   Now you know how it began. And you know what you must end.
Hurry now, time to stop Nith-
WAIT-
Don't. Even. Flinch.
She was faster than I expected. You have to get out... Find yourself before she finds you. 
Abhaoth:   She seems to have trouble seeing you... I wouldn't force my luck, though. 
Abhaoth:   Careful... she can kill you before you can blink in this place. 
Abhaoth: That's it, you're almost out. 
Abhaoth:   What the-
*Fading*  Zan?....  Zan?!.......

Rot. 509, Day 176 (The date of this last entry appears to be from well over two months ago.)
Received: Two crates of leather straps and a barrel of salt from lower Valc. Stored by the portal.
Received:  Three root oil jugs for Earth Mother Bendi.  Will keep them inside for when she drops by. 
The dwarven prospector should arrive by the end of the moon.
If he is wearing an elemental ring signet,  you may let him in. 
Day 233
We've had a strange tremor today...  the ground shook for a while, and I swear I've heard a quaint
tune going along with it.   Almost like some steam hissing down below.  Chilled me to the bone.  We've
also heard some rubble collapsing. Guess we'll have to look into it and reinforce the weaker caves...
And only a month after our army set off. I know I'm worrying too much but I so hate this coincidence. 
Find yourself. Before she finds you.
