ACT I
THE UNDERWORLD IS DYING 
Crystal Curator:    *Groans* 
Crystal Curator:    Look out!... Golems... 
Crystal Curator:    I... tried to stop her... followed through... the Disk... we have to stop her... 
Crystal Curator:    Look out!... Golems... 
Crystal Curator:    I'm too weak to move... had to use all my energy... to protect the Disk... 
Crystal Curator:    Look out!... Golems... 
Crystal Curator:    I can sense her... she's close... do something... 
Crystal Curator:    Thank you, Halfblood. I owe you my life...
I'd like to commend you for your fight back in the Sanctum, but alas, we have all failed...
But the Elf is close, I can sense her power! We still have a chance to recover the Disk!
Crystal Curator:    Let us hurry! We can't let her get away like this! 
Crystal Curator:    *Groans* 
Crystal Curator:    Hmm... doesn't look like the handiwork of our sisters. The demons must have executed these poor bastards. 
Crystal Curator:    Strong mana. I would have been dead weight without it... thank you once again. 
Crystal Curator:    Wretched thorns! Sadly, I'm not particularly proficient with fire magic. 
Crystal Curator:    Farm plots... The Disk's removal has made the crystals unstable, depriving the flora of energy.
If we don't recover it soon we might end up surviving on lichens and fungi once again. 
Crystal Curator:    The Iron Division banner? Well this is an unusual sight. We must be in one of the Cult towns...
I'm not familiar with the invasion plans but our sisters have certainly run this place through the blade. 
Crystal Curator:    These ruins must date from when humans still worshiped the Elemental Gods. Before the schism.
Look at these fresh graves... someone must have been here after our sisters attacked. I don't like this... 
Crystal Curator:    Iron Division crates... but I doubt our campaigning sisters would leave anything useful behind. 
Crystal Curator:    The Cult has decayed into madness and debauchery... this place is such a disgrace... 
Crystal Curator:    An impressive library I must say. The Cult scribes must have been hard at work. 
Crystal Curator:    What a lively fireplace... ready up, warrior, this place is not deserted at all. 
Crystal Curator:    I may not age, but I'm not getting younger either...
...do I really need to follow you up there? If you find me a good position, I could stay and watch your back. 
Crystal Curator:    Onwards! I can sense the Disk being just ahead of us! 
Crystal Curator:    Steel yourself, I feel like we're in for a lot of fighting. 
Crystal Curator:    That book oozes unholy energy... I wouldn't touch it unless I were a half-demon. 
The bubbling water oozes a powerful energizing aura. 
This patch of grass looks as if it was unearthed at some point. You could dig it with a proper tool. 
Crystal Curator:    There she is! After her! 
Crystal Curator:    Damn you, elf! 
Crystal Curator:    Watch out! 
The dry thorns are too thick to be moved apart. 
This wall looks like it could be broken with a proper tool. 
Crystal Curator:    Oh no- 
A powerful magic ward keeps the gate sealed. 
An unholy pentagram keeps the gate sealed.
Crystal Curator:    This ward is too powerful for me to dispel. We must find the source of this dark energy first. 
This door is locked from the inside. 
This door appears to be stuck. 
This door appears to be blocked from inside. 
This door requires a Copper key to open. 
This door requires a Dark key to open. 
This door requires a Withered Vine key to open.

I retreated from the town, for I could not bear what they had me do. I shall wait for my end here and
repent... but you still have a chance. I have buried something that will show you the way. May the great
wisdom of Air descend upon you and His breath carry you from this decaying place. Remember His place...

I've buried the key behind the farm plot shed. This will buy us some time. We are leaving as planned. - C

(An old parchment is posted on the wall. It's covered in ancient symbols that you can't quite understand)
Crystal Curator:    Hmm... that looks like an ancient human dialect. I'm not familiar with it.

They caught Calmun, to all Hells with the old man's map, we need to leave NOW! West gate, after the sermon.

[...]I won't end up like that lunatic they walled off inside the cathedral... I still can't believe what
they forced my brother to do...  no, this is too far.   This isn't what the Cult was supposed to be! [...]

This is it. They found out about my affinity for magic during the bloodletting. I must now pursue the
path of an Initiate... I must offer them the gift of my sight. But I knew this would happen one day... 
(A dusty parchment lies on the table. It's covered in ancient symbols that you can't quite understand) 
(A wrinkly parchment rests on the floor, a thick pellicle of dust covering it)
My faithful servant, you were indeed right.     The Iron Division orcs and their allies have launched
a full scale assault on our hellish domain.  Once this bold affront is dealt with, I shall send my Demon
troops to reclaim your shattered outposts and deliver the punishment for your failure to stop them...
Make sure nobody leaves your petty little town, or the consequences will be worse than death. - B.B. 
By the law of the Blue Baron,
This establishment has been condemned due to forbidden practices. 
(The ledger appears to keep track of various taxes and vassal contributions) 
If you see any strange objects appear out of nowhere, collect them and have them sent to the new factory
right away. Tell your men to stay put and prepare for the worst. I won't stay here much longer.   -   Nithriel 
Keep the upper courtyard grates closed!
Anyone who disturbs us gets a hundred lashes.
