Crystal Curator:    Halfblood, wake up! 
Crystal Curator:    Aid me! Slay these beasts! 
Crystal Curator:    They won't stop coming! You have to find a way out! 
Crystal Curator:    That door over there! Try to open it! 
Crystal Curator:    Hurry, Halfblood, I can't hold much longer! 
Crystal Curator:    For the Iron Division!!! 
Crystal Curator:    I shall hold them off, go now! Find the Elf! 
Crystal Curator:    Leave, Halfblood! You must retrieve the Disk! 
Crystal Curator:    Go already! Our fate lies with you now! 
Crystal Curator:    Don't be a fool, listen to me! Run! 
Crystal Curator:    Can't... hold out... much... longer... go! Go!!!

(The hefty book seems to have belonged to a demon. Pages decorated with hellish glyphs contain an undated journal)
We've arrived at the mansion, following the Blue Baron's command. Hah, how delightful was to see these malformed
bastards give us a royal welcome! They must be scared shitless after hearing the orcs broke out of their caves and
started running their towns through the blade.    We'll be staying here until their pitiful invasion gets torn apart.
Few days in and I'm already growing tired of this place.  While setting up the unholy books to protect the main gates,
one of the three brothers who own the place came up to me, asking to allow him to keep the tomes.   I couldn't care
less who holds them as long as they're in the compound but then his sister shows up and starts making a fuss about it.
I see the little shits are trying to fight for dominance now that their old man kicked the bucket.   This should make
for a little entertainment, as long as they don't push us Demons around.    We're only here to keep the orcs away...
The greenskin have finally showed up! I don't know what's funnier, them failing at breaking our warded gate, or the
cultists panicking that they are setting up to besiege us.  I wish we could go stomp them, but orders are to stay put.
Something happened. First, this weird lightning storm brews into the Crystal Dome, and then Mistress Nithriel comes
out of nowhere, panicking these bastards even more. Something made those crystals the farmers use fade, and now
the crops are dying. Sounds like the orcs holding up outside have suddenly become a problem. I don't like this at all.
I'm starting to get real pissed off by these siblings and their schemes. The Spirit Wench has vanished all of a sudden,
leaving her brothers to turn the place into a mess. One of them convinced a part of the servants to lock themselves in
the basement while the other took over the chapel. Looks like we'll have to dish out some discipline around this place. 
(The greasy pages of the tome appear to hold the journal of the Body Master)
16/3rd/1106.   Darn it, the rumors were true!   Those bleeding Iron Division orcs are up to no good again, having left
their hideout and pillaging our towns!    'cept word is, this time they're out for war!  The Blue Baron better be ready
to deal with this.  I can already see the droves of wounded he'll send me to sew up. Better start the preparations...
18/3rd/1106. At last!  The demons are here to protect, and they've brought these unholy books... told the servants
to keep an eye out for them.  My cursed siblings will surely want to get them for themselves, so they can show who's
the house leader.   Oh, but the servitors are loyal to me.  Who else treats their wounds after the sermons, hmm? Hah!
19/3rd/1106. As foreseen, Orc filth have come knocking at our gates! The unholy seals have made our defenses truly
impenetrable...  though this makes me even more worried of what my brothers are up to. What if one of them thinks to
sell us out and leaves us all defenseless?!     I'll have to switch some of the staff tasked with digging out the temple
to spy on them.   We've unearthed most of the important ruins anyway. Hah! So close to discovering the secrets of the
elves!   The power of their legendary healing water is my ticket to claim over the mansion and break up the orc siege! 
Anum 0 - Foundation of the Schism
[...]   And then I ask you, follower - why should you serve the caprice of the Elemental God?  Have you not been given
powers to shape the world from birth? Have the Elemental Gods built the towns and castles and ports that make the
empire? Have they made the saw that cuts the plank? The cart that moves the brick? Then why slave away, offering
your lamb and golden ring to their altar?  Man has power to build the dam that holds the flood, the wall that stands
the quake, the well that quenches the fire.   Man knows the hardship needed to fight the fury of the Elemental Gods.
And so I ask you, my follower  -  you wish to spend the afterlife serving in their pantheon, or grasp the reins and take
your rightful place as a God?   You own the Body, the Mind and the Spirit - keys to your freedom and salvation.  Shed
yourself from the confines of this shallow world, and hone your three gifts through hardship and sacrifice. Only then
you shall be ready to ascend into the afterlife as a God, and look with pity upon the blind fools that serve still.  [...]

Day 14, 3rd Quarter, Anum 1106
I have noticed my brother having quite an anxious grin at the dinner table today. Must be something in regard to the
elven temple he's taken an archeological interest in.  Perhaps it's time for me to scry the outcome of his discovery...
Day 19, 3rd Quarter, Anum 1106
Why, who comes knocking at our gates today? The orcs? A mere day after we welcomed our demonic allies with a feast!
Their unholy tomes have proven their power already.   One could not even touch them without demon blood boiling in
their veins.  Luckily for me, I have honed my telekinetic skills quite well. I shall see how my siblings will react soon...
Day 54, 3rd Quarter, Anum 1106
Mistress Nithriel! What a pleasant visit it was. We had a conversation about the Crawlers and Golems we've received
some weeks ago. The training goes well... they have such interesting minds! Sadly she seemed rather preocupied with
my sister.  At least my idiotic brother is still trapped away, unable to distract us.  I have many questions for her... 
(The Spirit Mistress' journal appears to be written in a strange language that you can oddly enough understand)
21, 3rd Qrt. An. 1106
Demons have been around for three days and I've already grown tired of them.     Their stench has permeated the
entire mansion, and the uncouth looks they give me and my Warlocks are disgusting. I'd have them put in cages if it
weren't for the orcish scum they're holding at bay. There is so much tension flowing around... I grow ever restless.
Day 50, 3rd Qrt. An. 1106
An Initiate has approached me today, asking for a Soul Stone. Apparently, the all-enlightened Body Master has
been trapped by his brother into the temple ruins and needs my help to escape. Couldn't care less for his fate, I
won't allow such powerful artifact into the hands of a lowly apprentice. To make sure he won't try to steal it, I
have enchanted it to always shift its position when faced.  It should be enough keep it safe for the time being...
Day 54, 3rd Qrt. An. 1106
To my great surprise, Mistress Nithriel has visited us today. She looked rather exhausted, carrying this strange
disk with her. I asked if it was related to the recent storm and the decay of the crystals, but she wouldn't tell.
She asked me to claim one of the demon books and accompany her.  At last! A chance to leave this cursed house!

(Judging by the poor grammar, the journal must have belonged to one of the servants. The last entry seems important)
Today Body Master give me his room gem to keep safe. Mind dogs lurk around library but they don't know gem is with me. 
NO PASSWORD, NO ENTRY!!! 
I knew it would happen!  That Mind Master slime has waited for us to find something of value and used his spells on
our brethren! Someone stole the crystal powering the inner temple gate and trapped my master inside! I went to look
for the scum and found him in the chapel, guarding the temple key with a powerful psionic field.  He knows well that
we outnumber his men, so he's planning to starve my master out! And no other cyan crystal we tried could unlock him!
We've got to move in and claim the stolen one. After some research I've found a way to create a crown that provides
psychical protection. We could break the field and take the bastards out! But first, I need a few more items to finish
it...   the brain was easy to obtain, and the Spirit Mistress certainly has a Soul Stone. But then I would also need one
of those Psi-shrooms... they only grow in areas affected by high psionic emissions, so it will take a while to find them.

Since our conscripts may either miss their tongues or ears, we concluded that the best way to handle
the password is to write a set of words on a paper and simply show it to the door guard after knocking.
You will receive a new scroll every week. Make sure to take care of it, and incinerate the old one. 
One of the demons has given me a hint on how we can break the seal and steal the book from the concert hall.
We can use a specific harp tune to shatter it, which I have detailed in the music sheet. Use the small harp to
practice and then go retrieve the book. Once you break the seal, our demon will help you carry it back to us.
(You practice the harp tune following the instructions)
PS:  Careful with the harp, it's more expensive than you are. And be ready for a raid, the demons' commander
has caught onto some of our plans. I can only hope our insider isn't actually planning to get us all butchered. 
(The dust covering this ledger is so thick you can hardly make out any of the names signed beneath) 
Keep an eye out on the Demons and see if they move any of the unholy books. We need to know where they are if we are to
claim them for ourselves. And don't raise suspicions! I can't afford to lose you, I need someone who can read!        -  B.M.
- One book is kept inside the recently dug out temple vault, under my watch
- One is in the mess hall. Keep the cellar door shut and use the password!
- One is in the chapel, shielded by my wretched brother and his mentalists...
- A servant saw him move another book to his quarters using his mind powers
- The one held by the Demons in the theatre hall will be the hardest to get...

KEEP OUT 
(The torn, dirt-caked parchment looks like it was carelessly discarded by someone. It is signed by a Pit Lord)
I'd like to remind you all that the unholy seals are the only thing keeping the orcs outside the gate from tearing
your worthless flesh apart.      We are growing ever tired of all the plotting and bickering over who gets to own the
unholy books. We're stationed here by the will of the Blue Baron, and won't hold back from culling any attempt at
undermining our authority by force.     So stop fighting now, or we'll start stomping out your empty cultist skulls.
