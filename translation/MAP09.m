This gate requires a Crystal key to open. 
Lith:   *Hums*
Abhaoth:   Not yet.
Nithriel has found me. She has dampened my strength...
...you're close... but I cannot guide you any longer...
...hold onto your breath. Someone is about to redeem herself.
Lith:   *Gasps* 
You see Chieftain Zura inside the tank. She doesn't seem to be conscious. 
Cerberus:    *Whines* 
The starving Cerberus seems to be gnawing on a key. 
The steel bars look scratched and worn out. 
The switch appears to be functional but the security bars won't budge. 
This door requires an Earth key to open. 
This door requires an Axe key to open. 
This door requires a Crystal key to open. 
The switch does nothing, but you don't have much need for a portal anymore.

There appears to be an issue with the lab storage doors in the southern operation rooms. The switches seem
to open the door across instead of the door they're next to.        If this is some sort of farce, then I assure
you that neither me nor Cosena's melting face find it funny.   I need a Fixer to come sort this out quickly. 
(A lengthy briefing details the first phase of the Iron Division campaign)
Assault on Outpost 3
[...]    Once our covert squads are in position and the crystal light signal is given, the bulk of the force will
commence the assault. Using our newly researched toxic gas, the forward units will attack the palisades (while
the Division advances) and hinder the defenders.   It is a known risk that the gas might spread within the outpost
but since the inhabitants have been confirmed to be possessed, 'civilian' casualties are more than acceptable.
The assault is expected to be over in few hours, with no losses on our side.     We do not expect the humans to be
in shape to defend themselves, let alone suspect our sudden strike.     However, it is likely that the demons will
become aware of our intentions as soon as we run their first batch of slaves through the blade, and therefore,
the Lancer Council has instructed us to preserve as many resources as possible to avoid future logistic strains.

(The diary appears to belong to Witch Chieftain Adjunct Lith. Many of the final pages seem to have been torn away...)
Day 188. No. No! NO! That wretch Zura has denied my project! Dangerous?! I would have expected anyone but HER to
say such an ineptitude! She was the one supposed to bring my ideas to the Council... no, no, no, I will see the Lancers
myself tomorrow. They will see beyond the veil, yes, they are much smarter than Zura! They do not fear the future.
Day 189. I cannot believe... the feeling... two weeks...  two weeks and they set off to their doom!  They would rather
throw themselves at death than take my plan into consideration.     For the first time, I saw it in their eyes, yes...
fear. They fear all my ideas. They fear the creation of the perfect warrior... a warrior that would surely overthrow
these weaklings.  Zura knows it too.  Oh, I understand now... that snake wants to steal my work and take Valc over!
Day 190. Oh, the swine... she asked the Council to remain in Valc during the campaign. Further her weapon research...
What a worthless lie! I can already feel her coming for my work... [...] The voice! The sweet cure... I passed out while
working in the midst of dark fumes.  Her words were soothing... an Elf.  A beautiful, pale Elf! I thought they had been
all eradicated by the Demons!   Yes, she hated the Demons with such passion, and had been watching me for so long...
(The next few pages appear to have been violently torn away.)
Day 196. It's been almost a week and Zura still hasn't approached me.  I have no time for her nonsense! Nithriel will
help me fulfill my research.  Yes, she still talks to me in my dreams...  words so old and true.  And only I can help her
crush the Demons, all while my ignorant sisters litter the battlefield.    Yes, Nithriel is right.   Today, it all begins...
Day 197. They are beautiful! And Zura still hasn't noticed the missing Goblins... no, she was not there to see my dear
Crawlers rise from their worthless flesh! Yes, yes, I can already see them swarm Hell itself! Just like in the dreams!

Day 202: I can hear them marching from here! Cluck cluck cluck! How dare they disturb my quiet sewer!?... oh!
They are leaving Valc!   The mighty Iron Division and their dim witted allies headed for the meat grinder.  This
means that I can finally fulfill the next part of Nithriel's plan. (The next sentences have been scratched off)
Day 203:   Ah, I can finally spend more and more time on my work now that the clinic barely gets any visitors.  I
have lost count of how many sleepless nights I have toiled here in the dark.   No dreams, yet I can still hear it.
Her words guide me. The Crawlers were mere child's play.   Now, it is time for me to create the perfect warrior.
(The third entry seems to be almost a month apart. The writing looks significantly shakier and harder to read)
Day 231:    This is it.  Zura knows for sure now.  She's noted my absences, oh she knows for sure.  She knows about
those missing Fixers, oh yes...     She will have me killed as soon as I finish the project.   Then SHE will claim it for
herself!    But Nithriel knows too...   tonight, Zura will bow to me.    Then, I shall leave to turn the Parapet Ward
off. Yes, enough dreams. Nithriel wants to see me in person, and the Crawlers aren't working fast enough for her. 
(A watered-down bit of parchment is clinging to the moist stone)
To: Chieftain Adjunct Lith
None of the Fixers have shown up for work today. I don't recall being informed about their... leave?

Potion of Might
1, 2, 3, 4 - Vial of Healing
6 - Potion of Haste
(Lith's write-over looks distressed. You notice many unequal heights and widths between letters)
Day 239:  All my sisters are dead now!  Nithriel's powers are truly inspiring! She took Valc over in a mere few hours.
And look what she's gifted me! My own stock of human slaves. Just what I needed to make the final adjustments... 
(A bloodied note lies by the dead Witch)
Lith has gone completely mad!   She was behind the missing staff members...  and this dark slime...   She's somehow
managed to make it grow and expand... for how long has she been doing this? Chieftain Zura is nowhere to be found
and (the text stops briefly). Humans! Warping in everywhere, we've been betrayed, we are falling back to Icepeak! 
(An ominous, dark sludge stains the side of the diary page. The smudgy text looks as if it were written with it)
Day 240: It breaks my heart to see them go... Nithriel had her henchmen ship samples of my corruption along with
my first generation of the successful experiment. My beautiful Golems... humans, orcs, all the same. Perfected.
Yes, I have made them all perfect, all beautiful! And right now, they are on their way to put an end to the scum
of Hell!    And after my foolish sisters retreat from the demons, I shall embrace them!    They will be perfect too!
Day 241: It cannot be!   My children!   Stupid, stupid, stupid!   She jumped from a ledge to her own death!   This is
how they reward me for dulling their sense of pain!   Carelessness!   Do they believe they can FLY now?!   Stupid!!!
Day 242: They are angry. No matter how hard I try, they fail to respect their mother. Traces of their precursor
self.  Oh, how they struggle!  Silly dolls, you have long transcended individuality.  You are part of the web now. 
(A blood-soiled diary page rests on the floor. The raw, red letters look freshly written)
Day 244:     What a delightful guest have I had visiting today! The Demonblood in person! Oh, I must prepare
her a proper welcome... no, no, she is so close, and my hair is such a greasy mess! Where'd I put that comb?...
