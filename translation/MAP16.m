Crystal Curator:    Looks like we're reunited on the battlefield, warrior. Time to do what we do best. 
Bear Warrior:    Strength and blood, Bonebreaker! The battle awaits us! 
Eraanthe:    Noisy oaf! Your chaotic assault almost got me caught! Learn to be more subtle!
What are you gawking at? Help me get the engine started, we can still catch up to the Baron's fleet! 
Guardian of Hell 
Lord Igrutius:    ATAAAAACK!!!
Hmmh?... Why are you fleeing, you fools?!
ARRGH, darn you and your trinkets, Halfblood!!! 
Crystal Curator:    FOR OUR HONOR! FOR OUR HOME! CHARGE! 
Earth Mother:    EARTH AND BLOOD! FOR VALC! CHARGE! 
Bear Warrior:    BLOOD AND HONOR! FOR THE IRON DIVISION! 
Witch:    BRING IT ON, SCUM! YOU'RE GOING DOWN WITH US! 
Reaver:    For Valc! For our fallen sisters! 
Fixer:    Uh- do we stay and fight? 
Blue Baron:    The Halfblood enters the board. Many pawns fall before her wrath.
Blue Baron:    A brash child. She knocks at Hell's gates incessantly... will anyone respond?
The evil Baron makes her wait...it's his home, after all. But look! The dog is eager to see her! 
Crystal Curator:    Your pet has fallen, Baron! And you're next! 
Witch:    Aww, no more bodies to throw at us?! You're next, tentacle face!!! 
Bear Warrior:    ARRRGH, BOW BEFORE THE IRON DIVISION! DO YOU HEAR ME?! WE'RE COMING FOR YOU!!! 
Reaver:    Our vengeance draws near! You're next on your list, Baron! 
Fixer:    Fuck! We survived? We aren't going after him without reinforcements, now, right?! 
Earth Mother:    Earth's might! Victory! Witness us, Baron, for we are coming after you! 
Blue Baron:    One loyal hound triumphs over another. The victor is rewarded with an open path to glory. 
Blue Baron:    ...will you bridge the gap? 
Blue Baron:    Will you reach the other side? Will you lose your heart? 
Blue Baron:    The spectacle culminates here. But alas, the Baron has long left his seat. 
Blue Baron:    Make haste now... the last ship is departing. 
Crystal Curator:    I can sense Nithriel's aura fading! She and the Baron must have fled to sea! 
Earth Mother:    I can sense the Baron's presence at sea! But we must wait for our sisters to catch up! 
Bear Warrior:    Looks like the Baron has fled! Gah, we have to wait for Grund and the others now... 
Witch:    Looks like we're too late. We might as well wait for our sisters to catch up, hm? 
Reaver:    The Baron's fleet isn't here... he must've fled at sea. Let's wait for our sisters. 
Fixer:    Uh-oh, I think the Baron's gone. We better stay put here and wait for our sisters... 
Reaver:    Over here, sergeant! 
Reaver:    Workshop Boss said you're the one who got the dark iron to fix our guns. We're ready to assist you! 
Reaver:    Workshop Boss said you're the one who got the dark iron parts to fix my gun. I'm ready to assist you. 
Reaver:    Fat bastard! 
Fixer:    Ugh! I'm gonna throw up... 
Bear Warrior:    The fuck was that abomination? 
Witch:    This torture chamber... such a cruel exhibition of flesh...
Earth Mother:    It certainly puts your laboratories to shame, Witch. 
Crystal Curator:    Sounds like our sisters are fighting outside! We must aid them! 
Earth Mother:    Sounds like our sisters are fighting outside! We must aid them! 
Reaver:    Looks like our forces are pinned down on the far side of the square. Let's give them a hand! 
Bear Warrior:    Our sisters have made it to the other side of the square! Rrrargh, let's join the battle! 
The shell is loaded with hell powder and ready to have a large caliber warhead attached. 
You don't have a proper shell casing to attach the warhead to. 
The shell reloading device looks ready for use. 
Earth Mother:    The Baron is so close! I can sense his wretched aura! 
Crystal Curator:    Onwards! I can sense the Baron nearby! 
Reaver:    Now that's a punch! Time to finish them off! 
Fixer:    Ka-boom! 
Witch:    BOOM! Hahahaha! 
Bear Warrior:    Push forward! Let's finish them! 
You don't have any loaded shell to fire from this cannon. 
The cracked window looks like it could be easily shattered. 
Lord Igrutius:    Imbeciles! Why did you bring the experimental cannon?! Can't you see none of the shells are loaded!?
Lord Igrutius:    And why is it facing the wrong door?! Take it away!!! GRRRH! 
Bear Warrior:    They're trying to run!!! CRUSH THEM! NO SURVIVORS! 
Witch:    Hahaha, look at them flee! You can run, but can you hide?! 
Crystal Curator:    Our valor is striking fear into their hearts! Onwards! 
Earth Mother:    Face the fury of the Earthborn, humans! You have nowhere left to run! 
Reaver:    Looks like they're fleeing! Let's finish them off. 
Fixer:    Look! They're fleeing! Does this mean we won? 
Witch:    Bonebreaker! Have you broken any bones today? Leave some for us too, yes? Hahaha! 
Witch:    I'm a ruthless beast, rarrrgh! Look at all the bodies! All that delicious red stew I spilled! 
Witch:    *Shouts loudly* Come on, red scum! Send us more bodies so we can make red stew! Hahahaha! 
Witch:    *Grins wickedly, with pupils expanded from whatever frenzying potion she consumed* 
Witch:    Urgh...sorry sarge, but I'd rather keep my teeth clenched than have them clattering. 
Witch:    Took a bullet from one of those new demon guns. Bounced inside my arm... hurts like a bitch! 
Witch:    *Groans* My amulet's shield only stopped it from exiting my body. Fuck this piece of shit! 
Witch:    *Groans heavily* 
Bear Warrior:    WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU! MY EARS WON'T STOP RINGING! 
Bear Warrior:    THEY AMBUSHED US, BUT WE PUNCHED OUR WAY THROUGH AND TOOK OVER THE BARRICADE! 
Bear Warrior:    THEY SHOT THE CANNON AT US! A SHOT SO STRONG IT COLLAPSED THE BUILDING BEHIND! 
Bear Warrior:    THEIR ARTILLERY HAS GROWN STRONGER SINCE OUR LAST SIEGE! WE GOTTA STOP THEM NOW! 
Bear Warrior:    *Bloodthirsty growls* 
Bear Warrior:    Strength and honor, Bonebreaker! I see you are drenched in cultist blood! 
Bear Warrior:    The battlefield is our ancestral home! The elder spirits watch over us! 
Bear Warrior:    Victory or death! This battle decides the fate of the Underworld! 
Captain Dura:    Still alive, sergeant? Our foes have been far more prepared than we expected. 
Captain Dura:    So you've cleared the eastern part of the town, right? And no sign of any of our targets? 
Captain Dura:    Grund ordered us to secure the bell tower so the cultists can't signal for reinforcements. 
Captain Dura:    Scout ahead, see if you can pick up any clue on where Nithriel and the Baron are hiding. 
Captain Dura:    Hey, have you seen Tiati? She was supposed to sneak past their defenses and assist my squad! 
Captain Dura:    Hmm, looks like you could use a healer. Take my Earth Mother along, I'll tend to the wounded here.
Earth Mother:    As you wish. Ready when you are, Zan. 
Earth Mother:    I'll help you however I can, but I have many other wounds to treat, Zan. 
Earth Mother:    Earth protect you!

My Lord, our craftsdemons have made the adjustments as per your request, using the new machinery at the
smeltery.   The finely ground crystals have yielded surprising results when mixed with our own hell powder.
The attached warhead is the new highest diameter that won't blow the cannoneer apart. High regards,  M.

Send me your daughters, and I shall forge their bodies in iron! 
Rejoice, my brothers, for our shared toil brings us closer to our goals!    Lord Igrutius Himself has
informed us that following her flawless invasion of the orc stronghold, Mistress Nithriel has used
her blessed mind to create new technologies!   For once in our bodily existence we can see the hell
powder used in guns worthy of garnering the interest of the Lords, an interest much stronger than
that of the fire and the arcane.  Rest not, as we must now toil harder, for change is drawing near!

flesh to this passing realm. And they tidied the temple, even if they had no eyes to see its forgotten glory.
