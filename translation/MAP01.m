Welcome to Hedon's beta testing hub!
Select a level by jumping in one of the pits and using the front wall.
You will get the standard gear for the level once you jump, but you can
grab more items from the room here, though it's not advised for 1st runs.
Please give me all your feedback and report bugs through ModDB comments

Orc:    Look out! 
Bear Warrior:    Look out! 
Goblin:    Look out! 
Reaver:    Look out! 
Orc:    Zan! Over here! 
Goblin:    Over here, sergeant! 
Orc:    Over here! By the windows! 
Goblin:    Over here, Zan! By the windows! 
Orc:    Hey, Zan! Come over here! 
Goblin:    Wait, sargeant! Need some help here! 
Bear Warrior:    Am I glad to see you, sarge! The demons got us trapped in here, we need help. 
Bear Warrior:    The horned bastards have sealed off every exit! There's no way we can get out of here. 
Bear Warrior:    These bars are way too thick, I can't break them. Help us figure something out, sarge! 
Bear Warrior:    All these ambushes... our squad got separated and torn apart one by one. 
Bear Warrior:    We're running out of ammo and time. Soon, they'll be all over us! Do something! 
Reaver:    Hey, Zan, good to see you in one piece. We're cornered in here, you have to help us! 
Reaver:    The demons have blocked all the access points to the cathedral, separating us from our squad. 
Reaver:    I tried squeezing through these bars but no dice. We don't have much time until they come... 
Reaver:    I can already hear the Cerberi howling... We're just sitting ducks in here! Darn it! 
Reaver:    We've lost so many sisters... I hope our main force is having better fortune. Screw this mess...

This seems to be activated somewhere else. 
I think that tremor from two days ago is related to these giant worms that have been pestering
us.    Since I already need to head back to Valc and drop by the Clinic to have my finger checked
on, I might as well inform the Lancer Council about our problems here. Be back in two days. -Dura 
Chieftain Zura, I have news. We managed to capture one of the worms that have been troubling us
lately.   You could send in one of your Witches now, we will do our best to aid her research. I hope
we find a way to deter them before they cave in all our tunnels, and fi - (the text ends abruptly) 
Given the recent events, the shutter has been set to close back after a short period.
Don't use it unless you can signal someone to let you back in.        The waterfall gate
is to remain closed until the Witch arrives.   We can't let that accursed worm escape.

The dwarven prospector should arrive by the end of the moon.
If he is wearing an elemental ring signet,  you may let him in. 
I'm writing this with my dying breath..this woman.. came out of nowhere and snuffed everyone out before we
could even draw our weapons...  I was the only survivor...She vanished as quickly as she appeared, and left
some odd pentagrams...then cultists started gating from them! Killed a few but one stabbed me in the leg...
If any sister reads this...   rush to Valc...  if Demons are behind this, they must be after the Crystal Heart... 
POWER CRYSTAL STORAGE ROOM 
As you may know,  we have been called to join our sisters in the Iron Division's campaign.      We will likely be away
for months, and someone needs to tend to the camp this time.   I know you're eager to further your apprenticeship,
but we cannot take everyone with us.   Tend well to our home, and make sure to gather some firewood, as the cold
moon is almost upon us. Earth Mother Druga has also left you a task, she needed some help with finishing an amulet.
I'll leave you my Spike Gun,  you know where to find the extra mags.     And try not to drink all the wine this time. 
As your mastress has probably informed you, I need you to finish making an amulet for me. I've
brought a crystal to the shrine of the Moon Goddess, and I expect the final magical processes
to be complete in a month and a week from now. All that is left for you to do is offer a Moondrop
Flower on the pedestal. It's a pale flower akin to a lotus, I've recently witnessed one blooming
near the stone circle.  Once you get the amulet, look behind the fern upstairs for a switch that
opens the secret path to Valc. Head to the Grove, and leave it to the Reavers in charge. -Druga

I've finally received one of those crystals from the Lancers. They call them Time Shards. Quaint object,
it seems to have no bond with darkness, nor gravity.   Wherever I place it, it will float peacefully in time
and space. I was instructed not to fiddle around with it while not wearing my protective crystal amulet,
for I'd burst into ash in mere moments if I were to break it by accident. I need to find some time to study
it further.    If only my sisters hadn't decided to begin their campaign and call us all to arms right now... 
B. I've managed to get one of those odd protection amulets from the Orcs. However, I'll need the
proper crystals to recharge it.   I know it's no job for a fence,  but see if you can nab some glowing
shards when they prepare the supply caravan, and drop them at the spot we agreed on, along with
the rest of my gear.   I will pitch in with this nice ruby I've... acquired.   Make it worthwhile.   -   G.

Captain Dura's Log - Rot. 509 Day 238
I really don't like these small quakes.    Earth forbid we wake up with more cave-ins.   And the
crystals seem to be acting weird too. The Power Cores have been running out unusually fast...
Gah,  this place makes me feel so claustrophobic.      I did tell the goblins to carve the ceilings
higher, but they kept going on about the heat going out faster that way. I miss working in Valc. 
[...]   and now everyone's nervous while waiting for that dwarf to arrive.     We've suspended the mining
operations, lest more quakes bury us inside the tunnels along with those wretched worms.   They're big
enough to swallow a goblin whole! We were making such smooth progress... these caverns are chock full
of crystals, almost as many as there are rumored to be inside the Crystal Heart.  No wonder that the
Lancers have sensed the power in here and sent us in. Maybe we manage to dig up more than those cyan
magnetic formations or the yellow power shards.  Hope the dwarf will be able to sniff out some mithril. 
(A wrinkly parchment rests on the floor. You translate the demonic language with ease)
My faithful servant, you were indeed right.     The Iron Division orcs and their allies have launched
a full scale assault on our hellish domain. Once this bold affront is dealt with, I shall send my Demon
troops to reclaim your shattered outposts and deliver the punishment for your failure to stop them...
Make sure nobody leaves your petty little town, or the consequences will be worse than death. - B.B. 
Rotation 509 - Day 233
We had a huge tremor today. I went out to check on the others and was surprised to see the elevator was
not working.   After exchanging a few shouts with the goblins up inside the mine barracks, we figured out it
was the switch that needed a new power core - good thing we had a bunch stocked up in the storage room.
It's times like these when I'm so glad I asked Earth Mother Druga to grow the steel-vine doors for me. I'd
rather rely on ancestral magic than some wacky goblin switch. Speaking of crystal magic, the veggies are
growing very quickly, and the chick eggs are about to hatch!    We won't need food from Valc for a while...
Rotation 509 - Day 237  ?
That blasted worm's hissing is driving me crazy! It tried chewing through the vines, but they're too solid
to yield. I can't get too close or it will spit this freezing cold slime at me... Gods, what is this creature?
Rotation 509 - Day 238  ?
I woke up to a screech today? Hard to tell the time down here anymore.  The worm has found the chick
hiding behind the shelf...  that poor bird didn't stand a chance.  I'd go in and gut that beast, but Dura
wants to get a Witch from Valc to study it first.   What an ordeal...  I tried going up to get a drink, but
the elevator is out yet again. At this rate we'll run out of power cores, and the goblins are too scared
of cave-ins to go break more walls. Oh, Earth, why so furious? Have none of our offerings pleased You?
