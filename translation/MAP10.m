Bear Warrior:    Sarge, you're alive! Thought you were done for in that crashed elevator.
Reaver:    Good to have you back. We hadn't made it too far before we got pinned down by Forge Elementals. 
Good to have you back. Haven't made it too far myself... got pinned down by some Forge Elementals. 
Reaver:    Zan! I thought you were dead in that crashed elevator. Can't believe you made it.
I tried to push on without you, but got pinned down here by some Forge Elementals... 
Tiati:    Zan... I couldn't stop her... she made it inside... 
Crystal Curator:    Begone, elf! The Disk won't bring you anything but doom.
Nithriel:    Your barrier won't last forever, orc. The only doom here will be upon you.
Crystal Curator:    It doesn't have to last forever... I have some friends at my side. 
Crystal Curator:    It doesn't have to last forever... I have a champion at my side. 
Nithriel:    *Laughing* Oh? Well so do I...
Bear Warrior:    For the Iron Division! 
Lancer:    Victory or death! 
Reaver:    Uh-oh... 
Pit Lord Alpha 
Reaver:    Die, demon! 
Lancer:    Face defeat, hellspawn! 
Bear Warrior:    Bow before our might, scumbag! 
Nithriel:    Such a display of might, Demonblood...
...but sadly, you are too late.
Nithriel:    See you in Hell!
Lancer:    Follow her! We can't let her get away with the Disk! 
Reaver:    Quickly! We must pursue her! 
Bear Warrior:    Elf bitch! We have to follow her, quickly! 
After a fierce battle, the grotesque demon finally collapsed, his dying roar echoing through the halls.
Stumbling towards the massive doors, the Half-Orc forced them open, gathering breath for her final fight.
Yet her fists unclenched as soon as she found Nithriel holding the mysterious disk  -  she was too late!
The Warlock wasted no time, conjuring an eldritch portal and escaping the orc stronghold with the Disk...
But Zan was hell bent on not letting her get away. Driven by a swift impulse, she plunged into the closing
wormhole, following Nithriel into places unknown...

Having repelled the last wave of invaders, the Iron Division defenders rushed to the Heart.
They found nothing but massacre and destruction... the Sacred Disk artifact - gone.
Both Zan and Tiati seemed to have disappeared without a trace, leaving many questions behind.
Thanks to iamfailtacular for the bits of character and lore inspiration
The invasion was over, but the damage left behind by Nithriel's attack etched a deep scar into Valc.

Lith had already met her swift demise. She was prepared for cremation and stripped of all honor.
Chieftain Zura was recovered from Lith's tank, and urgently put under intensive treatment.

With the high rank Lancers having perished, she assumed temporary command over Valc.
Her efforts, however, focused on studying Lith's notes to cure and revert the horrors she had created.
Moreso as she was carrying the dark poison herself...

Inside, a lone Dwarf began to slowly put things back in order. 
Lancer Dendra was ordered to return to her base and ensure the functioning of the anti-magic ward.
Her time split between burying her sisters and standing at the edge of the mountain. Watching. Waiting.

Days passed quickly as the few surviving members of the Iron Division struggled to restore their stronghold.
But as tunnels were cleared, stragglers were rescued and bodies were buried, time seemed to flow slower...
And questions began to arise. What happened to the campaign against the Demons? No messenger had arrived...
Why was the Disk artifact so important to Nithriel? How would it change the future? And where did Zan go?
End of Hedon I - Crystal Heart 
Bear Warrior:    Over there! A Lancer! 
Reaver:    Over there! A Lancer! 
Bear Warrior:    Oh, fuck! 
Reaver:    Have you seen the size of that thing? 
An empty socket. 
A set of amber glyphs is etched into the sides of the empty pedestal. 
A set of green glyphs is etched into the sides of the empty pedestal. 
A set of silver glyphs is etched into the sides of the empty pedestal. 
A set of aqua glyphs is etched into the sides of the empty pedestal. 
Bear Warrior:    They're opening the Council Room! Get ready for another wave! 
Reaver:    They're opening the Council Room! Brace the defenses! 
Bear Warrior:    They're opening the Council Room! Get ready for another wave! 
Reaver:    They're opening the Council Room! Brace the defenses! 
Bear Warrior:    Look out! Right corridor! 
Reaver:    Look out! Right corridor! 
Reaver:    A demon!!! 
Bear Warrior:    A demon!!! 
Bear Warrior:    Look at this thing... What the fuck were they trying to conjure here?
Reaver:    Guess we'll soon find out. 
Reaver:    This pentagram is huge... wonder what they were trying to conjure here.
Guess we'll soon find out. 
Reaver:    Looks like they've closed down the shutter gate from inside.
Gotta find a way to open it... I can also hold here and attack them when it goes up if you wish.
Bear Warrior:    Not a bad idea, I'll stay here too if you want, sarge. 
Bear Warrior:    Damn it, they've locked us out with that shutter. There should be a way to open it... 
Bear Warrior:    Phew, thanks for the rescue! The bastards trapped me inside this tank!
They've set up in the library ahead. We could breach in from here, take 'em unprepared. 
Bear Warrior:    *Muffled* Heeey, get me out of here! 
Bear Warrior:    The pump is right there, turn it on and get me out of here! 
Lancer:    A timely arrival, sergeant. I could use your help. 
Lancer:    I heard Nithriel and a demon passing by a while ago. He sounded awfully... large. 
Reaver:    Damn it, we're too late. Nithriel might have already breached the Heart!
Lancer:    Let us hurry, we've no time to waste! 
Bear Warrior:    Damn it, we're too late. Nithriel's just shattered the defense!
Lancer:    Let us hurry, we must stop her at all costs! 
Lancer:    Our sisters have fallen... we've no time to waste, Nithriel must be right by the Heart! 
Lancer:   Look alive! Time to make our founders proud. 
Reaver:    The Crystal Heart... I've only heard stories about this place.
Lancer:    'tis the essence of our existence. And we are its only hope now. 
Bear Warrior:    So this is the Crystal Heart... this place is... weird.
Lancer:    The birthplace of our generation. We are its only hope now. 
Lancer:    Crystal Heart. Essence of our World, we come to defend you. 
Bear Warrior:    Zan, over here! 
Reaver:    Hey Zan, over here! 
Bear Warrior:    Zan, over here! 
Reaver:    Hey Zan, over here! 
Lancer:    Good to see you're still holding, sisters. 
Reaver:    Well met, sisters. 
Bear Warrior:    Hail, sisters! 
Reaver:    Am I glad to see you, sergeant! We could really use your help! 
Reaver:    Die y- ...Zan?! I can't believe it's you!
We've got to link back up with the defenders!
Tip: You can order certain friendlies to follow you/hold position with the Use key (DEFAULT: E). 
Iron Division Survivor:    Hey, Zan, you're alive! Let's kick some cultist ass!
Tip: You can order certain friendlies to follow you/hold position with the Use key (DEFAULT: E). 
Bear Warrior:    Hey, stop that! We need these bowls. 
Witch:    The fuck are you doing? Knock it off! 
Earth Mother:    What are you doing, Zan?! I really need the mana... 
Wounded Shieldguard:    Aye, aye, what good is a bottle if it's empty? 
Captain Dura:    Well, well, well, look who made it... 
Captain Dura:    Dendra wants to talk to you, she's in the patio behind us. 
Captain Dura:    I'd rather have my Crushbow at hand if you don't mind. We have other supplies to spare if you need 'em. 
Lancer Dendra:    The crystal key, Zan. Don't forget to take it before you leave. 
Captain Dura:    Good hunting, warrior. 
Captain Dura:    So, Tiati saved your ass, eh? She's not here if you wanna thank her, Dendra sent her on recon duty. 
Captain Dura:    I was at the Witch Clinic just over a week ago. Everything looked so... normal back then. 
Captain Dura:    That bitch Lith was behind all this mess! I still can't believe what she did. She's ruined us... 
Captain Dura:    Bah, to all Hells with Lith! We gotta focus on the battle at hand. We haven't come this far to lose it now! 
Captain Dura:    It looks like the cultists have taken a break from attacking this wing. They're up to something... 
Captain Dura:    Good to have you on board, sergeant. Must have been a hell to make it here. 
Lancer Dendra:    Over here, Zan. 
Lancer Dendra:   At last, you have arrived. I am Lancer Dendra and I've assumed command of the remnants here...
Tiati has informed me about your... unexpected return to Valc. She's also found out about Lith's betrayal and
this Nithriel character that so eagerly wants to break us apart.  Alas, we have no time to fret so I'll be brief.
Thanks to you powering up the Parapet ward, Nithriel's ability to teleport more cultists in has been severed, thus
allowing us to hold the defense of this wing. Behind us lies the very Crystal Heart - which we shall die protecting.
In our desperation, we called for the power of the Earth, and collapsed as many entrances in the temple
as we could. We bought time, but also blocked ourselves from reaching the defenders in the western wing...
That is the only other place to access the Heart.    We used to keep in touch with the Lancers in there
through the crystal ball but we've recently lost all contact. The cultists have so far focused on us...
But a few hours ago, Nithriel has vanished from the front line, leaving a handful of her minions to keep us
busy here. I've sent Tiati to find out what she's up to, but she hasn't returned yet. I fear for the worst...
Yes, I need you to go find out what Nithriel is up to.   It will not be an easy task, but you shall not be
on your own. As a sergeant of the Bear Warriors, I shall entrust you with commanding your own squad.
Take along a few sisters to aid you, if you wish.  You will also need this crystal key to gain further
access. Now take whatever supplies you need, and get going. Find out what Nithriel is trying to do...
Oh, and one more thing...  we don't need to know what happened to the campaign, Zan. Morale is low enough
already, and knowing that we might be the last of our kind won't help us now.     Keep the story for after. 
Press Use to skip briefing 
Lancer Dendra:   Take a few warriors and find out what Nithriel is up to - she might try to break through the west wing! 
Lancer Dendra:    By the way, is that... my Crylance that you're carrying? Nevermind, must be a coincidence... 
Lancer Dendra:   I'd say Nithriel is trying to shift her remaining forces towards the western wing. 
Lancer Dendra:   If the cultists are indeed pushing west, then the defenders across will need you to reinforce them. 
Lancer Dendra:   You must hurry! If they manage to breach into the Heart we will be doomed! 
Tiati:    Go get her! You can't let her take the Disk! 
Tiati:    Her magic is simply too strong... she managed to conjure this giant demon... 
Tiati:    I'll be fine. Stop wasting time! 
Wounded Fixer:    ... 
Bear Warrior:    You're a sight for sore eyes, sarge. Are our sisters finally sending back reinforcements? 
Bear Warrior:    We carved our way here from the Barracks with Captain Dura. These cultists are everywhere! 
Bear Warrior:    Sounded like a hell of a fight outside. Too bad Dura ordered me to stay here and protect the wounded. 
Bear Warrior:    Don't know for how long we can keep holding up. We barely have supplies for another day... 
Wounded Shieldguard:    Oh, no, no, I'm not wounded, I'm just... argh- layin' fer a bit... 
Wounded Shieldguard:    Oh, I still 'ave some skulls to crack! 
Wounded Shieldguard:    What in all the Hells happened to Icepeak? Why aren't me brethren here yet, darn it! 
Wounded Shieldguard:    At least I'm surrounded by women. Aye, t'would be a good day to die... 
Wounded Witch:    Buzz off. 
Wounded Witch:    Heard Tiati shot Lith like a fucking dog. I would have plucked her eyes out instead. 
Wounded Witch:    Look, just go pester someone else... 
Wounded Earth Mother:    If you don't mind, I'd rather be left alone. 
Wounded Earth Mother:    It's hard enough to focus with this head wound, would you please move along? 
Wounded Earth Mother:    ... 
Reaver:    This is so bad... they've overwhelmed us from inside our own impenetrable stronghold. 
Reaver:    I heard they took over the Plaza in mere minutes. Wonder if the Grove and Reaver HQ met the same fate. 
Reaver:    I was close to the Lancer's temple when the invasion began. Had enough time to get here and regroup. 
Reaver:    Killed a few. Took a few hits as well. Nothing the right potion couldn't heal, though. 
Reaver:    Setting off to stop the Warlock? I'm ready to join you.
Tip: You can order certain friendlies to follow you/hold position with the Use key (DEFAULT: E). 
Bear Warrior:    So, you actually turned the anti-magic ward at the Parapet back on? That really saved our skin. 
Bear Warrior:    They wouldn't stop pouring out of those magic pentagrams. Seeing them fizzle was a huge relief! 
Bear Warrior:    All this treachery and corruption... I heard Lith was downright possessed. She screwed us all over. 
Bear Warrior:    We're low on supplies and our morale is even lower, but we'll protect the Heart to our last breath. 
Bear Warrior:    So, you're moving out to the west wing? I'm at your command.
Tip: You can order certain friendlies to follow you/hold position with the Use key (DEFAULT: E). 
Bear Warrior:    Easy on the food, there isn't much left here. 
Reaver:    Dendra is in charge now. She's inside, go talk to her. 
Reaver:    Dendra is inside with the wounded, we must defend them! 
Reaver:    Get whatever weapons and ammo you can and let's push them back! 
Reaver:    Bastards! 
Reaver:    What a mess... 
Reaver:    Not now, Sarge. 
Reaver:    We held them off... for now. 
Reaver:    Watch out for those toxic clouds! 
Reaver:    Don't know for how much longer we can hold out... 
Reaver:    ... 
Bear Warrior:    Fuck! Can't believe we survived that onslaught! 
Bear Warrior:    For the Iron Division! 
Bear Warrior:    Keep your eyes peeled, this isn't over. 
Bear Warrior:    Grrrh!... 
This door requires a Crystal key to open. 
Lancer:    I don't have any crystal key on me, we'll have to go back and search for someone who does. 
This door requires an Earth key to open. 
The fire won't yield. 
The gates won't budge.
