Earth Mother:    So the ancestral home of the minotaurs has been butchered by demonic contraptions... disgraceful! 
Fixer:    Uh... Zan? I d-don't think we should move any further! This place looks d-dangerous!

Fixer:    Uh... Zan? I d-don't think we should be here! This place looks d-dangerous! 
Earth Mother:    'tis nice to see a friendly face within this fiery inferno. 
Fixer:    Hello! 
Bear Warrior:    You're looking for a sapper team? Hmm, they should be in the mines to the east of here. 
Bear Warrior:    Nice to have you here, Zan. Guarding this place sucks, but we can't let the demons return. 
Bear Warrior:    You sure left a mess around this place. Gotta love blowing some shit up, eh? 
Bear Warrior:    These machines make so much noise and heat. It's starting to get on my nerves. 
Bear Warrior:    I can't believe the demons had the brains to build such a place. It rivals the Valc Forge. 
Reaver:    We haven't seen any sappers come by. They might be trapped in the eastern mines, outside of town. 
Reaver:    With the demons being able to teleport around here, we need to keep our eyes peeled. 
Reaver:    We can't let the horned assholes recover their gear. Too bad we can't just blow this place up. 
Reaver:    Who knows what other weapons would have been made here if you hadn't shown up to stop them... 
Reaver:    I swear I heard voices coming from one of the machines. What kind of power runs through them? 
Fixer:    Aaah! A demon!!! ... oh.... Zan, it's you. You startled me! 
Fixer:    I'm supposed to document the way these machines operate... but I'm too nervous to stay focused! 
Fixer:    I can recognize bits of dwarven and Iron Division technology within this unholy patchwork. Creepy... 
Fixer:    I touched a pipe and I started hearing whispers. It's as if the factory is fuelled by damned souls... 
Fixer:    I can't help but wonder who helped the demons build this place... it's scary, but also impressive. 
The mechanism appears to be missing a lever. 
The machine does not seem to have enough power to be operated. 
You'll need a proper tool to mine this ore vein. 
Lord Efri:    You slime!!! I will bring your head to the Blue Baron myself! 
You have nothing to offer to this shrine. 
The pedestal is empty. 
The door does not seem to have enough power to be operated. 
A hellish curse prevents you from unlocking the gate. 
The elevator does not seem to have enough power to be operated. 
The door is locked from the inside. 
The door seems stuck. 
Master, the knowledge retrieved by Mistress Nithriel's cultists from the orcish town has yielded results! With the
production at full strength here, we shall soon hold a new weapon in our hands, a weapon that will far surpass the
crude creations of the greenskin!  Using their knowledge of the crystals and our knowledge of the hell powder, we
shall soon wage a new form of war!  The battlefield will shake under our force of sheer destruction!     -     Lord Efri 
After the recent theft, master Igrutius has ordered the demonic gates to be cursed so that only Pit Lords and
their Hellblaze guards may use them. Keep the cultist scum away from our precious machines at any cost! Start
carrying the supplies by yourselves, and remember that the Blue Baron is expecting results soon!      -     Lord Efri

The gating channel has been re-established. When you have any new items to transport,
ring the bell three times and a servant will be summoned most hastily to retrieve them.

I told you it would be foolish to overload the machines! Now that we've lost that power pillar, we cannot
use both the elevators and production machines at once!     Get someone to release the safety of the 4th
pillar before I have you all flayed!     The Blue Baron himself will feast upon our souls if we fail here!

We're storing surplus munitions and hell powder here until further notice. Count the inventory regularly!  -  Lord Efri 
(You scrape a parchment from the dirt. The sentences feel like they were written months apart)
Curse the day I learned to write.   Now I have no rest until I put my pains on this sheet.   I don't know what year it is.
The gates remain sealed, with only Demons gating past them to oversee our work. With every day we toil, the demonic
machines make their nest into this old town, giving it a new fate. Today, a wall I broke revealed a room with tablets.
I memorized the symbols on the tablets and threw them away. I still wonder why the Demons forbid their knowledge...
The machines are nearly prepared and the Pit Lords are pleased with our work. We had double rations and rest today.
Something big upset the Demons. They cut our rations and made us toil harder. It's been long since I've written here.
The others are getting suspicious, I must hurry.   I think I understand this nail-like writing now.  The riddle speaks of
walking in a fire pit.   That must be the pit with the six torches right next to the tablet!   I shall muster my courage,
and walk through it... and the gate will open for me! I can only imagine what lies beneath there... it will soon be mine. 
By the order of the Blue Baron, your rations will be halved until the orcish invasion is culled.
The harder you work, the sooner it shall end!     -     Lord Efri
(A sentence is written over the bottom of the poster)
You know what to do. Start with the black list. 
(The symbols etched into the ancient tablet resemble a familiar form of the common cave language)
If knowledge in the arts you seek
But your hoof melts in the pit
Pay respect to your six masters
And the power you shall muster
When your goals will fail to hide
Walk the fire pit with pride
For your hoof will hurt no more
As the gate reveals the halls.

POWER SURGE WARNING: DO NOT ACTIVATE WHILE THE OTHER 3 PILLARS ARE IN FUNCTION 
Though the power pillars can produce enough energy for the entire factory, the new machines have been straining
the distribution, like bloated ticks feeding upon a slumbering bull.       Make sure to turn off any idle machines and
redirect the power to the central pool - the fiery gauges will show us precisely how much energy there is to spare.
