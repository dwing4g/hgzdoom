Bear Warrior:    Man, this place is colder than Moon's ass...
Reaver:    At least you have some fur on. 
Reaver:    *Shiver* So. Cold. 
Bear Warrior:    Huh, a live one... 
Reaver:    Looks like we have a survivor. 
The thick layer of ice has a cracked spot that could be shattered with the proper tool. 
The pedestal is empty. 
It looks like the bridge has been destroyed by a fallen ice block. 
You don't have enough materials to fix the bridge. 
Sick Dwarf:   *Coughs* 
Bear Warrior:    Too late for him now. C'mon, let's stop wasting time and get moving. 
Reaver:    Did he just breathe?... hm, must be my imagination. Let's get going. 
Reaver:    Let's hope this was worth it... 
Bear Warrior:    There you go, buddy... 
Andrik:   *Cough* Argh, that hit the spot! I can feel it purging me veins!
Thought she could do ol' Andrik in, did she?
*Rasp laughter* I've drunk far worse than her poison... though nothing
ever made me see horned blue demons in orcish garb wandering about.
Aye! T'was one of your witchin' sisters. Called herself Lith.
Reaver:    Lith? That's Zura's aide... yes, this does look like the work of a Witch... 
Bear Warrior:    Lith?! Zura's adjunct? That piece of shit... 
She came by a few days ago. The snake must have slipped something in our well...
Almost everyone here was complaining about stomach cramps by the end of the day.
I saw them, lass. Screaming in pain. Dark veins shifting under their skin...
Then one of yer Lancers showed up at the fortress. Aye, and she was fuming!
Said that she was going to burn that traitor alive, and rushed to the elevator!
She couldn't aid us. We tried everything to help the sick ones. Nothing halted the poison.
...and then these bleedin' cultists appeared out of nowhere...
T'was a slaughter. Killed everyone who could hold an axe, and threw the sick ones into the well.
They would have thrown me as well had the taint claimed me sooner. My blood is slowing it down.
Listen, lass... you seem to be an honorable individual. Why don't ya take this elevator key
and go give that traitorous wench and her lackeys what they be askin' for? Go quickly!
Bear Warrior:    Oh, screw Lith! We have to defend the Crystal Heart now, we'll get her after. 
Reaver:    I'd love to hunt her down, but we have more pressing matters at hand right now. 
The dwarf tries to speak, but ends up coughing. His dry tongue bears a slight purple tint.
His brows narrow as he proceeds to mimic a drinking gesture and point above.
Bear Warrior:    What are you trying to tell us, dwarf?...
Bear Warrior:    He looks pretty bad. I don't know, sarge...
Bear Warrior:    His tongue looks so dry. Maybe a drink could fix him? 
Reaver:    He looks poisoned. Look at that violet tongue...
Reaver:    I have a bad feeling about this. Do we really have to help him?
Reaver:    What in the Pits of Hell is this dwarf trying to say?... 
Andrik:   I would do it myself if I had my strength back. 
Andrik:   Don't worry about me. Go find that filthy Witch! 
Andrik:   I don't know where the cultist bastards came from, but thanks for slaying them. 
Andrik:   Stone harden ye! 
Andrik:   Go lass, no more time to waste! 
Andrik:   Off with ya! 
The lever operating this half of the mechanism is nowhere to be seen. 
You have nothing to smelt. 
The sturdy anvil looks ready to be used. 
The switch does nothing. 
This door requires an Earth key to open. 
Bear Warrior:    Finally! Let's get back into Valc. 
Reaver:    Back to Valc, at last. There might still be hope. 
Reaver:    Killing that dwarf was probably for the best. We can't risk having him contaminate this place. Now back to Valc... 
Bear Warrior:    Good call killing that dwarf... can't risk having him spread that corruption around. Now back to Valc... 
Reaver:    Did you hear that? 
Bear Warrior:    You hear that? 
Bear Warrior:    Uhhh... 
Reaver:    This isn't going to end well... 
TO ICEPEAK FORTRESS 
(The last entry in the book is signed by Lancer Dendra)
The journey has been a mess. The road's been nearly entirely swallowed by snow, and many of the ice
caves have collapsed, I've even lost my lance in a cave-in, and perhaps I would have lost a lot more
if I hadn't shielded myself in time...    It feels unnatural for the ground to tremble like this, and the
Dwarves wouldn't normally slack with tending to the path to their fort.    Perhaps Earth Mother Eva
can shed some light on what's going on.  I didn't find her at home, so she must be inside her grove. I'll
spend the night here and pay her an early visit tomorrow since the dwarves are expecting me by noon. 
A Study of the Ancients by Earth Mother Eva - Chapter Three, Mechanisms
[...]   I am thoroughly impressed by the precision with which the Ancients have built their contraptions.
It appears that the temple which I'm observing has a trap system meant to keep looters away. It must
have been hundreds of years since the last Ancient set foot in here,  but the trap still works  -  luckily
I have studied fire magic long enough to protect myself from the bolts hurled at me. Besides the trap,
I'm researching a gate mechanism that's operated by the same Cyan Crystals we've learned to make
use of.  Perhaps deciphering the nearby inscriptions will help me understand more on how the crystals
function.   I'm certain that their magical power is doubled by a sort of intelligent design or force.  [...]
Thankfully, the ice has preserved a lot of the temple's architecture in good shape.     Still, I cannot
use my magic to melt it lest I'll cause damage, so I'll have to break it with whatever tools I can get. 
(A ripped piece of parchment rests on the stump. The writing looks shaky and distressed...)
She's dead!   I found Mother Eva laying by her tree, a foul glass in her hand.   Her skin was rippling with
dark veins and her tongue was violet... the dwarves are not capable of such treachery, and this poison
looks far too sophisticated for the humans.  The least I could do was bury her in the earth, so she may
rest with her kin at last, but now I'm headed for Valc. Witch Chieftain Zura will have some questions to
answer.  And if you who did this returns here, you have my word that no hole will hide you from justice. 
I saw the brewers haulin' some new furniture in their tower yeer'day. I walked up to Torgrind and asked 'em
what in all hells is he doing with that orcish junk.   He shrugged me off and told me it's stylish!    More stylish
than what WE make?! Next time he comes around asking for new kegs, make sure to point him to that bleedin'
elevator below, and tell him to go ask the orcs fer help. Surely they can craft him some stylish ale kegs too. 
As we have replaced our old bellows with a crystal powered machine, apprentices shall be allowed to use it to smelt
metal.   Simply place yer ore or ingot in the hot hearth, and it shall melt in a mere moment.   Once yer mould fills up
ye're as ready to work it over the anvil as ye'll ever be.  Make sure to turn the heat off before ye clean the hearth.

Tales of Brother Bernard - Brother Bernard in Hell
[...]   and in his search for the dry water and cold flame, brother Bernard hath found himself lost in
the Pits of Hell.     The boiling tar and pungent sulph did not bear well with him, but alas, he could
find the way back naught.   He daren't ask for directions from the sneering devils, lest they would
trick him even farther. Our brother hath pondered well over how could he elude this rotten place.
Thus he hath pulled a string from his satchel and began to measure Hell left and right, hammering
stakes into the ground.  The lord of the devils - who hath been lurking within a puddle aside - would
endure watching brother Bernard no longer, as the seed of curiosity crawled hastily into his veins.
'What dost thou do here, fool?  Why art thou measuring my fiefdom?'  asked the trickster.
'Why I am wishing to build a temple here!' would exclaim our crafty brother.
Upon hearing his word, the devil's eyes hath grown red with angst. With a sharp whistle he would urge
his fellow tricksters to grasp brother Bernard, and throw him out. So hath he escaped the fiery Hell. 
The Dwarven Society - Introduction. A Summary of the Guilds
[...]    but the Priests are not the only ones to assist the Dwarven Lord. Among his advisors are the
masters of the Four Guilds. Their practical knowledges are essential in upholding Dwarven Society.
The Blacksmith Guild is composed of miners, smiths and jewelcrafters, all able to turn the lifeblood
of dry rock into weapons, armors, ornaments and various mechanisms and other mechanical wonders.
The Carpenter Guild fosters woodcutters, locksmiths, leatherworkers and tinkerers, able to shape
the forest into a precise tool.  Their ballistae and catapults are feared across all the battlefields.
The Stonemason Guild trains master builders and engineers. Be it wells, keeps, towers or bridges, the
singers of stone are responsible for the backbone of our life and society, as well as our advancement.
The Brewer Guild spreads our name across the land with their chefs, healers and alchemists. It is also
known that they dabble in the less honorable art of espionage, but their skill may be needed at times. 
My Lord, the lock for the treasury has been successfully installed. The combination is 1357.  - Jaromir 
If you are reading this, then the orc traitor must have fulfilled her task.     Your duty is to finish off any of the
dwarven survivors that have not been affected by the poison  -  it will be easy to tell which is which by the color
of the tongue and skin at a later stage. Once the healthy ones are dead, dump the tainted ones into the dungeon
below the fortress and have it locked down.   Don't visit back or let anyone else do so, unless you wish for death. 
Closed until the Iron Division campaign ends.
