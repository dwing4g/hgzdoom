Eraanthe:    There's the Baron's fleet! Don't get any funny ideas now, wait until we reach the shore! 
Reaver:    They're trying to board our ship! 
Crystal Curator:    They are attacking us! To arms! 
Bear Warrior:    Arrgh, they're boarding our ship! Push them back! 
Witch:    Umm, ladies? I believe our ship is being boarded. 
Earth Mother:    Oh my! What was that? Are they trying to board our ship? 
Fixer:    Huh? What's that sound? Is someone climbing on our ship?! 
Eraanthe:    Sounds like they're trying to board our ship. Go deal with them! 
Blue Baron:    *Murmurs* 
Blue Baron:    ...the ones who defy their masters perish first... 
The cracked door window looks like it could easily be shattered. 
Nithriel:    Oh my... I was not expecting guests. Come in, Halfblood, don't be shy... I'm just around the corner. 
Nithriel:    Surprise!
Tiati:    Zan... she's...c-controlling... me... urgh-
Nithriel:    Surprised to see your little friend here? She was rather helpful with retrieving the Seed for me.
The Baron was slightly reluctant to share it, but thanks to you two, it's in my possession now!
Tiati:    Zan... ugh... go-
Nithriel:    Silence, worm! Your pitiful savior is powerless before me now. I'll enjoy draining the life out of y-
What?! Where did y-
NOOOOOOOO- 
Eraanthe:    Don't pester me now! I must make sure the boat stays on course. 
Fixer:    *Is too absorbed by the surrounding machinery to notice you* 
Fixer:    N-not now, Zan! I-I need to focus! 
Earth Mother:    Let me know if you are in need of my magic. I'll tend to you however I can. 
Earth Mother:    Earth protect you! 
Bear Warrior:    Stay sharp! They might try to outmaneuver us! 
Bear Warrior:    This is it, the Baron is in our reach! For the Iron Division! 
Reaver:    I'll lay down covering fire, go kick their ass! 
Reaver:    Keep your eyes peeled, they might try to board our ship again. 
Witch:    Well, Bonebreaker? Are you crazy enough to board the Baron's ship? 
Crystal Curator:    I'll protect the ship! Go find Nithriel!

Captain's Log
57/3rd/1106   I thought this was going to be a regular supply run, but lo and behold, the Baron appears perched up
atop of his flagship, observing our fleet.   I think my contact inside the minotaur town factory will have interesting
news to share... granted he hasn't been worked to death already. I better watch my thoughts now, the Baron is close.
58/3rd/1106   We were greeted at the port by the warlock chief bitch. Her face was more wry than I remember. If only
I could've heard what she told the Baron.. everyone looks to be more agitated than usual. I need to meet my contact.
59/3rd/1106   A million curses on that wretched elf! We barely dropped anchor for a day and she orders us to prepare
to leave. Urgently. Wonder why the Baron doesn't put her in her place. Much to my expectations, her cultists did load
our ships with weapon crates, and a bunch of Hellions joined, slinging around the new hell powder guns I heard rumors
about. My contact was right... if these contraptions catch on, politics will soon shift. Now... how do I ride this wave? 
I will be spending the rest of the journey locked inside the engine room, as it appears to be the only place capable
of shielding me from certain intrusive thoughts. Make sure none of our bumbling cultists open the doors! -Mistress N
